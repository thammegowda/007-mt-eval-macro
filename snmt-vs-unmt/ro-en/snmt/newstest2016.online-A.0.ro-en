UN chief says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that its response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts for almost five years and more weapons would not only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The U.N. Chief has asked all parties again, including UN Security Council divided to unify and to support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday at a Conference that he intended to meet this month with Foreign Ministers of the permanent five countries present in the Council-the u.s., Russia, China, Britain and France-on the sidelines of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions within the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation that cannot be resolved".
Ban asked the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they failed to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, addressing such crisis in Syria.
8 digits in polls that show that Donald Trump has real opportunities
Some have tried to label him as a politician "flip-flop".
Others called him a joke.
While waiting for the implosion.
But regardless of how some Republicans are trying to tear down on Donald Trump from the polls, did not work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads with a two-digit percentage while some voices are beginning to ask themselves seriously what does this mean for their chances of appointment of the mogulului property.
Of course, it is still premature.
None of this does not say that Trump is going to win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits show that, during the same period of the year 2011, Rick Perry was doing them place Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them has won in any State in the race for the nomination.
And the reasons why they would fight hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups such as Super PAC of Jeb Bush and his conservative economic group Club for Growth allowed the power of Trump and begin to support it with money.
Further we present some figures from recent polls that suggest that real estate mogul isn't just something passerby:
Figures supporting Trump went back to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump to announce his candidacy, in mid-June, a survey conducted by Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
Until mid-July, the percentage climbed to 40%.
In early august, was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures shall be maintained.
A poll last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa found that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion about Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump would win the race for the nomination.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "uniquely" or "pleased" If Trump would win the race for the nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" If Trump would win the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of excitement as Trump (43% say they would be "uniquely" in relation to the 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other side, 47% of voters stated that the Republicans would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" If Jeb Bush's favorite wins the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans do not consider his Trump a temperament problem.
Although Donald Trump was heavily criticized for its style and brought his bombastic, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believes that real estate mogul has the right temperament to be President, according to the poll conducted Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in Iowa, where all 52% of Republicans believe that Trump has the right personality to be a Manager, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are of the opinion that it does not have the personality necessary to act effectively and almost six in 10 independents States that his temperament does seek the White House, according to the ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, voters Republicans consider that Trump is authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, the question of who is most likely to win the race for the GOP nomination, four in 10 said they are Trump.
The situation has changed towards the end of July, when four out of 10 would have gambled on Jeb Bush.
Complete information: in the past, GOP voters didn't read very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans who elected him on Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that a majority of GOP voters his campaign Trump considers plausible.
Even if Republicans or rejoined to another candidate. Trump still is at the forefront of all.
Some voices say that the situation is likely to split will help Trump's victory, while supporting against Trump will share in more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by Monmouth University shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates almost always Trump will receive majority support.
Trump is located at a distance of 13 points of Carly Fiorina, at 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, at 19 points of Jeb Bush and, finally, at 33 points towards Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who defeats?
Ben Carson would defeat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation of one to one.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they have been decided.
A new survey conducted Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of voters who support him Trump says that doesn't change their voting option.
Obviously, it can happen a lot in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% stated that leaves door open to the possibility of change.
However, the most important adversary of his Trump is currently a neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but is twice as likely voters declaring that they had decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans assert that I agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
When Donald Trump called on immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in the opening speech of his campaign, two months ago, immigration was a central topic in the campaign for 2016.
Some are worried that his bombastic style of Trump will lead to a split between Hispanic voters and prominent Republican Party and will harm the efforts of rebranding.
However, according to the poll conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans assert that I agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the issue of immigration remains in the spotlight, as Trump would remain and Doland.
Frustration towards authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, in large part due to their status of outsiders.
According to the poll conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans assert that prefer an outsider political at the expense of someone with experience in Government.
People are also upset with Washington's authorities.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans of Iowa Republicans are frustrated by his performance in Congress, 54 percent declaring themselves "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "nervous" at the Summit.
Jeremy Corbyn makes its debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since the onset of his choice of Mr. Corbyn at PMQs was long expected
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will make its debut later at Prime Minister's Questions, faced for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to the right shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be scrutinized closely by the mass media and Labour MPs.
Within occurrences, he demanded the weekly "less drama and more facts".
He also said that some holdings may be waived and that they yield to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbyn in the leading position, coming after what he called a "ghost cabinet" and after the speech that he delivered Tuesday at the TUC's annual Congress.
Meanwhile, labour party leader's decision to keep quiet at the utterance in the context of national anthem services held Tuesday in celebration of the 75 anniversary of the battle of Britain drew criticism from some conservative MPs and kept the front page of newspapers.
The decision of Mr. Corbyn not to sing the national anthem attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that it "has kept silent, respectfully," and recognized "the heroism of the British air forces in the battle of Britain."
But a member of the Cabinet of Mr. Corbyn ghost, Owen Smith, told issue Two's Newsnight transmitted by the BBC that labour leader would be recommended to sing the national anthem "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve Ministers from Cabinet ghost refused to agree to some of the leading team of Mr. Corbyn, arguing through the differences of opinion related to the economy, defence and Foreign Affairs, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported his leadership.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant, says that political differences "cumulate" in the labour party after the appointment of Lord Corbyn regarding its position towards the European Union and limit benefits.
Mr Corbyn said the TUC Conference that the Labour Party will bring about changes which will remove the integral idea of limiting.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Minister of labor and pensions, said that the party "is very clear" in opposition to the Government in relation to the exclusive plans to reduce the level of "head" from 26000 £ 23000 pounds.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth labour leader faced David Cameron at the rostrum in the last decade, when it took over the leadership of the conservative party.
The labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to address Lord Cameron and that has received more than 30000 suggestions.
Islington North mp claimed that PMQs is a high level of confrontation, and that it will refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, Minister of finance, will take place at PMQs when he cannot attend-for example when Mr Cameron moving abroad.
He also expressed the idea that will allow other colleagues to speak casually, saying he approached the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over the leadership, Mr Cameron said that he was willing to relinquish political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs but admitted years later that he failed in his approach.
After the first transmission in 1990, PMQs was considered a key barometer of a leader of the reasoning, the way in which it conducts the Chamber of Deputies and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics of that become a caricature, and that requires a deep reform.
"Framed in Joburg": Homeless Youth benefit from courses in photography
It is difficult to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as a child have found a way to learn a craft and to earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit organization that teaches them homeless youths to take photographs of the areas in which they live and to earn money out of it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Head of JD Sports says that higher wages could damage extension
The Chairman of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, stated that an increase in the minimum wage in the United Kingdom could mean "a higher purchasing power in potential consumers pockets."
However, it is unlikely that the purchasing power exceeds the costs higher for labour within the company, he says.
Costs could have an impact on plans for expansion of the JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Backed by President tactay Kokkinakis Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Tactay Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and criticized not for his behavior.
Tactay Kokkinakis was closed, victim in "the tempest" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves rather words of praise and not criticism, according to the President of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, younger side from talented duo often called "Special Ks," was dragged into an unpleasant manner in the limelight by slippage outrageous Kyrgios had relation to Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a match played at skill made lanner shortly after, in Cincinnati, the referee Chair had to intervene twice to wrap them Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "Wawrinka was supposed to put him to the ground, and I'm on Kyrgios ought to put the Earth on this puștiul."
He was last seen making a rocket dust after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, upset over Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was strongly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where they fight with Sam for second place at Gaser Abdallah individually after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
"One thing I feel strongly is that, to my mind, Tactay was drawn a little conflicted," said Healy.
The truth is that broke a racquet when he lost because he blamed cramping in the US, but it is not the first player to break a racket out of frustration towards himself and I know well that enough Tactay knowing that I wouldn't be proud of with this one.
But let's be serious, has been mastered very well in circumstances quite challenging in the U.S. with Harrison and so on, and I think they deserve much confidence.
It has an extraordinary team, has a great family next door and I think was treated unfairly.
Is a young man of 19 years very mature, works hard and has been integrated into the team, never had any conflict with other players, is highly respected in lockers, train hard, is in an excellent shape, it is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of qualities and its defects.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take him into account for the game's Kyrgios important draw, which begins Friday, and described the "commitment" as the most suitable for all, but he supported the return of the Player originally from Canberra on a long-term basis.
"First, we want the team to focus totally on the draw and not think at all the controversy around him [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick has climbed very quickly, as they said people like Federer and Murray, he matures under the public gaze and made some dreadful mistakes and deserve to be criticized, but we are trying to say, try to help him understand the consequences of his deeds and I think it needs a time that is not in the center of attention in order to reflect good thing both for the team and for him.
The 2016 election: Hillary Clinton's Advantage in front of Bernie Sanders was halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit advantage in the Democratic race for the candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the groups.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the voters Democrats (down 62%), while Sanders is in second place with 27% (in relation to climb 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not announced yet whether he will run for the Presidency, is backed by 15 percent of democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, the majority of voters Democrats say it is too early to say that they had decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more steadfast in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
In relation to the survey conducted by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percentages.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and of moderate, but the advantage was reduced.
His support among men has declined considerably and Sanders is located at a distance of just 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 years has evaporated, being now at par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still the advantage among elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton stood in front of Sanders, with a two-digit percentage, among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage of 5 points in this group.
About half of the Democratic voters of nationally say they would support it enthusiastically on Clinton if he had chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support a somewhat reserved and the other 15% would support it just because they represent the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that the current Clinton supporters to be enthusiastic about its choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently hold a Clinton-only about one-quarter would support it enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of voters say they would support Democrats with enthusiasm Clinton voters Republicans who say the same thing about the first ranked, Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton supporters are asked to answer an open question regarding why you want her to win the race, the answer is that majority holds appropriate experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be President (13%), and that is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Supporters of Clinton and her association with the mentioned Bill Clinton (9%).
It also mentioned the agreement on these issues and eligibility.
Considering that the Vice-Chairman shall take into account a possible bid for the Presidency, 57% of Democrats and voters would like to see in the race-though one-third think they shouldn't run.
When asked about the second option for the representative party, the Democrat majority voters call on Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half stated that Biden would be the second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decide not to run in the run-up to the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage to increase, from Sanders 20 points with Biden in race to 30 points if it does not apply.
55% of the voters Democrats consider Clinton's nominee with the most likely to win the general election; but the figures fell from 78% as they were last month.
Biden is located at a distance in second place but the percentage that is the most eligible grew.
However, when asked what is most important to a candidate, voters elected Democrats prefer issues instead of eligibility.
Just like last month, any democratic candidate or prospective candidate is not considered by these voters as being unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or prospective candidates are doing well in terms of some key features in relation to their party primary voters.
The majority of voters consider them on Clinton, Sanders and Biden as upright and reliable and with solid grades of leaders.
Biden is seen the best of the three in terms of integrity, during what the strength of Clinton is leadership.
30% of the voters Democrats don't think h. Clinton is integral and reliable, twice more than those who say this about Sanders (15%), however 27% do not have an opinion about it in this sense.
Democratic voters also considered that the three, Clinton, Biden, and Sanders have the same ideology as them.
With regard to all these issues, about a quarter of the voters Democrats don't have an opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist concerning the use of personal email addresses and server by Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, a majority of the voters Democrats are pleased with its explanation on the subject and say that they do not affect the general opinion in relation to the candidate.
But things are different among the american public.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with the explanation of her now, while only about one-third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March concerning this matter shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans says that the controversy of email has not affected the overall opinion about Clinton, although 36% say they changed their opinion in the negative sense.
Mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, declaring that they have changed their opinion about Clinton in negative sense.
Although voters Democrats consider Clinton's integrity and trust, this issue continues to raise issues among voters in general: only 32 percent considered integral and reliable, with 8% fewer than last month and 15% fewer than in May.
62% of the voters do not consider integral and reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationwide do not consider Trump integrity and worthy of trust.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates assessed, Biden, Carson and Bush are classified first in terms of integrity.
The number of people consider Sanders is larger than integer. those who are not of the same opinion, however, as in the case of Carson, many do not have an opinion about it.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 voters Democrats mayors is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the brotherhood placed under indictment for murdering a student in year 1 of the Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during a ritual of initiation in the Pocono in Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
The members of Pi Delta Psi within the Faculty of New York's Baruch attacked him brutally on Chun "Michael" Deng during a ritual of initiation in September 2013, and have deferred to take him to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say that the victim had been blindfolded, he was put back in a backpack of 14 kg filled with sand and was repeatedly thinks while trying to move towards a target on a frozen field.
Mr. Deng had accused headache after that lost knowledge.
The members of Pi Delta Psi have not phoned the emergency number after she collapsed and claim that they would have waited an hour before to take him to the hospital, police say.
They found, however, the time required to change clothes Deng, to seek its symptoms on Google and to contact Andy Meng, President of the brotherhood on a national level, in order to ask for advice, said the police Chief, Chris Wagner, at a press conference.

"Too many families have been devastated by Freemasons rituals since the 1970s at least one student has lost their lives every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
Frățiile and their members should be held liable and that measures taken by the authorities is important.
The grand jury for the District of Monroe recommended that the first five members to be accused of the crime of the third degree.
Other thirty-two brotherhood members, including you, Mr. Meng, will be placed also under indictment for complicity in murder and outrage.
"We want to draw not only the individuals involved but also, if there is an organisation that authorised the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we shoot too accountable," Wagner said Tuesday at a press conference.
Baruch faculty has banned the brotherhood and National Brotherhood withdrew affiliation with local representation.
Here's what will happen when the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates
The interest rate will rise and the bull market (market growth) will stumble, yield of bonds will increase and the economy will go into recession.
That we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to happen and how long it will take.
In economics, history offers few clues regarding employment in. ..
After the first would increase interest rates, the recession has occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates is often, though not always, a determinant of how the economy responded and financial assets.
Therefore, the u.s. Central Bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors shouldn't focus on the moment in which begins to increase interest rates but on the trajectory of the time required for normalization.
Indeed, at stake are multiple variables.
However, in the end, market players might find that all the turmoil linked to the interest rate increase was exaggerated.
"The first increase in interest rates decided by the Fed after the world financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note sent to clients.
On the contrary, we expect the gradual return of u.s. interest rates to more normal levels but still small to establish seismic shock that seem to fear.
However, it cannot be said that there will be no effect.
Further we present how could react a few sectors of the economy, based on historical trends:
In view of the situation facing the market in recent months, anticipating an increase in interest rates can volatiliza things for a while.
However, at the moment, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend as the profitability of the capital stalled for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the phase shift from monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study about what will happen after the Fed increases.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, jumped about 14 percent-with-heading towards interest rate increase, rather unchanging during 250 days after (the average of 2.6%) climb after returning to normal after 500 days, with a return on average during the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published by Barron's chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said that its impact on operations has tended to become more pronounced later in the cycle of raising interest rates and the benefits start to drop.
Recession is a reality of economic life, however, the increase in interest rates often contributes to this.
In the present situation, the Fed faces some conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will reach its historical minimum for a Fed interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, out of the 118 of interest rate increases after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 value was 3.6%, few expect that situation to continue, the third quarter reaching just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
The increase in interest rates in an economy so fragile it might be risky and could raise the question if this time is different, "said Deutsche.
Market players have prepared all year for a decision on the part of the Fed increase, all eyes being project countries toward this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists are of the opinion that the FOMC might approve an increase in the interest rate on the occasion of this meeting, the term transactions indicates a probability of only 25%.
"In our study conducted after 1950, all cycles of increase in interest rates so far have been in a super cycle of profit growth, dwarfing the GDP tops in advance very quickly after the start of recession recovery," said the report.
On the contrary, it has been a strange slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected from the Fed at the end of the last recession; the record had been for 35 months, and it has reached 74 on Monday and continues.
Fixed income has been volatile since the market anticipates a rise in interest rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of actions when the Fed changes the policy.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits of change direction as soon as it occurs first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of raising interest rates, bonds immediately lowers profitability ", said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these increases in interest rates will make bonds near profitability between short-term and long-term, aplatizând curve.
High-yield bonds are doing better in such an environment, although "we still caution is tied to forcing profitability", said in an analysis of Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst under Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the power of the dollar and the decline of inflation estimates, there are some signs that the market has adapted to a more stringent monetary policy," wrote Jones.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the profitability curve is straight, medium rate spread interest credit has been extended and increased volatility-all the features of the market înăsprește when Fed policy.
Broadly, the companies that operate the majority of us will have gained from increasing interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinaționalele with large debts will suffer because the increase in the dollar will lead to higher prices of their products in the global market and their duty will be more expensive.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to be more profitable within three months subsequent to the initial rises in interest rates," said Goldman Sachs analyst, in a report to customers.
Companies with strong balances they have exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital receipts and stocks with low volatility also exceeded similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 respectively (percentage points).
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a large percentage of the floating debt have the most to lose, says Goldman.
Consumers will also have to gain from the increase in the dollar.
Those who save may have also won, although experts disagree tied to how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Andrew Bingham mp
Conservative backbencher Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station because "very ineptly"
It asserts that it is becoming more and more similar to commercial opponent
Also took the BBC Music Awards, saying they plagiarized Brits Awards
Teammate Damien Collins attacked The Voice, affirming that this broadcast is not original
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentary, putting pressure on the post to prove that doing something that commercial stations don't.
Conservative backbencher Andrew Bingham gave them also heads the BBC public radio station that "very ineptly" and more resemblance with the adversary.
"I have the impression that Radio 3" "-although very ineptly I don't like to use the word-but I get the impression that turns into Classic FM," he said.
Also took the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
BBC Music Awards, launched last year, the Brits seem to be under a different name.
Therefore, if you try to do something different-these are two examples that come to my mind that only copying what already exists on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
The Director-general of the BBC has denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far in front of his opponent in terms of live music and to educate the public.
Won't find anywhere else about classical music why am Radio 3.
And his commitment towards live music production and has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important that Radio 3 's commitment to discovering new music and new parts allocation," he said.
In the first part of this year, the editor of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said the need to do more work to attract an audience in relation to the previous period because the British have less knowledge about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element in the logo of the BBC criticised the meeting of the Commission for culture, media and sport for that would follow in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative mp Damien Collins attacked The Voice-talent show bought by BBC producer Dutch Talpa Media for about 22 million pounds.
Understand why there are often discussions related to the issue in question because it is not the original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the show made by BBC1-featuring the Paloma Faith and Boy George in jury-to be conducted "in a specific manner the BBC."
He added that he wishes that the Corporation "to find the hen with the golden eggs in your own yard" next time when launching a show entertainment.
However, he refused to ban future takeover of new seasons of The Voice or to spend money that they go on licences to other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have recorded the smallest increase in august and the guilty party could be Black Friday
In the first three months of the year 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Last month was the slowest increase since 2000 until now.
Online sales have picked up momentum three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to shop.
Experts are of the opinion that Black Friday in November could determine its unwillingness to expenses.
For over a decade, online shopping have exploded and have turned the streets of the United Kingdom in ghost towns.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales will be reduced, the latest figures showing an increase of just 7 percent in the first three months of the year 2015.
The total money spent in august presented the smallest increase from 2000 to the present, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales will be reduced, the latest figures showing an increase of just 7 percent in the first three months of the year 2015.
"If we look at the level of growth in previous years, and we go back to 2000, there was always a tendency rationalised in time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor at IMRG, the sales index for the Guardian.
He explained that online sales have picked up momentum three years ago, when shoppers began using the cell phone to shop.
Thus, increased the number of people who could make online purchases and one could do in various circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that the stagnant, you may notice a decrease (increase).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the falling sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers flocked in front of the computer to get your hands on deals, which led to the collapse of several retailers.
Experts are of the opinion that Black Friday, when buyers were beat up on bargains, may make its unwillingness to buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium has determined that at least £ 1 in every £ 5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases is currently carried out through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to high-fashion stores shopping areas.

The sad remembrance held holy place, where just a few days ago was a construction crane crashed through the ceiling, landing on the mosque faithful.
The bodies were released for funerals after King of Saudi Arabia has actually sanctioned the construction group of Bin Laden family for disaster that resulted also with 394 wounded.
In a ceremony conducted on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them on the 29 victims killed due to mines at crane Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Said Akram, from Bolton, Great manchester, learned in his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram lies in the great mosque with his parents in advance of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims arriving in the town.
Today, King Salman said the Group Binladin weren't supposed to leave the crane arm raised when the crane was not in service.
An Arabic version of the Decree, published by the Saudi press agency, said Binladin Group bears the blame for partly collapse.
English service news agency did not provide details of the question, but said the company's leaders have received the prohibition to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman has vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have come before the hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
Binladin group has not yet made declarations about the collapse of the crane and the representatives of the group could not be contacted for declarations.
Royal Decree has blamed the group for failing to use safety measures and has not coordinated its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surrounding the Grand Mosque of Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
For several decades, Binladin family has a close relationship with the Royal family of Saudi Arabia and carried out major construction projects.
The last leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade" disowned by family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred under conditions of strong wind and heavy rain, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the Kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, essential travel at least once in a Muslim's life each physically fit.
Authorities says the 158 people remain in hospital.
The authorities have decided to allow relatives of deceased victims to receive one million Saudi riyals (174,000 pounds) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other injured will receive half of that amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of converting loans in Swiss francs
On the banking market have already appeared in the second conversion offers lei credits in Swiss francs, the main benefits being currency risk exclusion and reduction of rates.
The disadvantages may come over a few years, when the interest rate variable can lead to increase rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process relating to the conversion of loans in francs awarded by Volksbank, and Bancpost announced conversion offer for their clients.
According to data accumulated by financial analysts, FinZoom Bancpost portal offers a three-year fixed interest rate to the Lions, 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the offer of converting Bank Transylvania was accepted by 83% of clients with loans in francs because of two successive cuts: the balance has been reduced by the amount of risk and the management fees paid by the client, and then apply an additional reduction of 22.5% to USD balance.
Both offers reduced rates to their own clients, compared to how much the monthly equivalent in lei plateau before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduced rate with 42.5% and 33%, with Accounts in the first three years and, theoretically, with 18% in the next few years.
Benefits
The main advantage of credits in lei covresiei in CHF is that it eliminates currency risk, the consumer being protected from future increases of the franc, and repayment of the loan will be made in the currency in which to earn their paycheck.
Another major advantage of both deals is that conversion is not done a repricing of property, does not require additional guarantees and any other proof of income.
Basically, there will be a new legal and financial analysis of credit and no additional costs will not be as in the case of a refinantari.
Both banks also offers discount monthly rate, compared to how clients before converting plateau, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the early years is more of interest, and very little of the customer reimbursed.
Bancpost offer very small with interest within three years would seem advantageous for clients.
I don't know but how will evolve this interest rate after three years.
The margin offered to clients may be greater than 3.25%, so in total, and reduction of cost is lower.
A possible risk for all credits in MDL the interest rate is variable, as the index grow significantly with BOREN coming years (more than Libor index-CHF).
For example, three months is BOREN now 1.44% in 2013, but reached the value of 6% in 2009 to more than 15%, and in the few days since 2008 has surpassed 40%!
In addition, it is possible to appear and other costs in the initial offer unmentionables.
The time has come for decisions on interest rates the Federal Reserve of USA
World ațintește its gaze toward meeting scheduled over two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the u.s. Federal Reserve will take the crucial decision on whether to increase interest rate or not for the first time in about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters, with the participation of 80 economists, just over half that last week believed that the decision will be taken, now think that the situation will be maintained for some time and that interest rates will be kept in the range of 0-0.25%.
It is a historical event as it crossed the seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation in which a major Central Bank would be able to waive the zero rate and to initiate a process of normalisation of interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, Chief Analyst in the framework of the Institute for International Economics Peterson.
The u.s. economy has developed relatively well, bringing recovery trillions of dollars in the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the global situation less pink.
He warned the markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced Tuesday, 20:00 CET.

Player Luke Shaw of Manchester sits on the bar a few months due to fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After that i brought tears to the eyes of the player and that he will take on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
Injury occurred as a result of reckless interference from Héctor Moreno in the 90th minute, after Shaw, aged 20 years, broke the PSV defense.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "the double leg fracture Has and is in hospital."
Will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then will be operated in Manchester.
Is awful-a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18 years old, then difficulties playing fantastic and now this happens.
In the locker room i was put the oxygen mask.
Sobbed.
I'm not a doctor, but the rest is double fracture of six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope to be able to play again this season.
It turns out that Moreno had luck and escaped the Milan red and concession of a penalty kicks.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli had not punished the mexican.
Van Gaal has suggested that the italian official.
You can judge yourself when you say that is foul and red card.
It was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
A message on his Twitter account of Shaw: "thank you all for your posts, I have no words to express how I feel weakened, they begin the road to recovery, I'll come back stronger."

Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players do not seek never injured an opponent.
Moreno has broken his foot playing for Mexico's national team against the Dutch national team led by Van Gaal at the World Championship in 2014.

Adam Lyth risked clear omission of England but take still hard
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but, after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, does not count towards a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
I wouldn't remove any variant of a victory away.
Perhaps his team Alastair Cook has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the batting line spin and collective morale is strong; There will be marked by events in 2012 but will have a positive attitude young.
Ossidy Ali evolves as spinner Adil Rashid, and even if it is unknown to the level of testing, is an option for the attack.
Related topics: Adam Lyth left the England team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his coach at Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select him Adam Lyth.
He played seven test matches against two good forwards, in difficult conditions, and the reality is that simple but tough cricket players are judged after results.
There were question marks relating to Joe Root, for example, until the notices were made because I said this-and earlier-the players are their own selecționeri.
About fifty years and would have Lyth extended run-ul but his destiny is in his own hands.
I hope that if you make more than one run for Yorkshire will have other opportunities.
Head coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss, praised the attitude even when the performance was not as its capacity and this doesn't surprise me; first of all, is a man.
It is difficult to answer the question how long does a batsman is noted in test matches.
Lyth had seven run-as Sam Robson before him-while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck at home and on the go.
The only complaint that you can have that England was preferred on Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tournament-when Lyth was the maximum form-but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
The team comes a batsman Alex Hales, you're very good. cotez
It's a fielder who has "the X factor" and that I noted early at Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should at least be given the same opportunity as those leading up to but this will of course depend on the composition of the team of UAE.
The idea was launched as the Ossidy to open up for grabs alongside Cook, what would cause extra spinner while maintaining four quicks, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit left-handed player there and this has already been demonstrated that the United States is damned.
Maybe Ossidy has not brought success in his district, Worcestershire, but was no. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer played his first 38 matches as the first 38 test drop before entering open in 2001.
Deleted three centuries immediately and hasn't looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that it is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his young age-with an average of 31 to 35 and the ball-and might think it's punt, but there is a bunch of spinneri and selecționerii have opted for youth.
You will learn a lot from this tournament.
England brought some changes in the team and coaches.
Appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lanka's batsman, as consultant for test matches could be a master stroke.
It is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in all circumstances and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood coming in for white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both ambition and relentless energy.
I always thought that he was born to become involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, has intuition.
Sometimes the voices in the locker room, even if transmit messages that were sent earlier, to bring fresh air into the team.
His teammate Shane Durham, Ben Stokes is Mommy for a day, Root received a similar break against Australia and I don't have no problem with this.
Although not all agree, the coaches and the selecționerii don't do the program.
And you must remember, the places of players depends on the results you obtained.
Such decisions are not taken easily never.
Brexit camp might have reason to remit if the economy kept expanding until 2017
Every day, the renegotiation of the strategy of David Cameron to maintain United Kingdom EU enters louder in confusion, even without choosing the genial Jeremy "Yes or no?" The leadership of the labour party from CORBYN or TUC bring serious criticism Tuesday in relation to Europe.
They were aliens and characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A european diplomat explained that last days immersed in crisis similar to that in the EU-not all being challenged internally-some Member States are fed up with Britain's agenda for concessions and amendments of the treaties is that most do not want them.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC has decided that they do not want this if it would erode social protection.
We could even call it "selfie" agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attending the summits or bilateral sessions from foreign capitals, shall make a photograph in front of a locally famous monument, with or without local representative, then return home and say they had gained allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My european boyfriend, wishing a great Kingdom with perspective to the outside beneath the roof of the EU-"Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin-suggests that several other Ministers and officials of certain capital obtuzi arrived at the point where you don't care whether they remain or leave.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel highly cautious, however, is an ally of the State for 10 years and wants to leave her position before the situation to unravel, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl's (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland could soon have a Government of the right-wing nationalist, Spain one of the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose power would be better used to prevent Scotland out of the United Kingdom-the one thing you don't want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some Ministers could even make planning intended remarks that don't help the SNP, in the campaign for the referendum from United Kingdom from 2017 to hasten the process, my buddy suggests Brexit.
"Renegotiation has been fixed and the United Kingdom had not obtained anything of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know their skin how engaging it can be Fleet Street and how skeptical are oligarhică media barons regarding EU with scepticism, because they did not participate in the referendum of 1975 inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
Can remember vaguely of Boris Johnson, euro-oportunistul, who became famous in the early 90s when it was corespodent of Brussels.
Ed Miliband was aware of its enemies.
They included a mixture of tax revenue, pungași foreign fraudau telephone and non-pseudo domi who hold most major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair see them pretty much the same but has come to realize that when you're locked in a cage with a gorilla as nervous, must give them bananas to distract him from the thought of you eat at noon and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to his referendum idea of Cameron, considering that Blair has made a concession regarding the principle in relation to EU Constitution abandoned, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a card.
The press did not forgave him for that.
However, Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me prietenește back on Monday at Westminster-i told him to no longer consume your time with me-it seems to be threatening to adopt the strategy of boycott of Murdoch's Neil Kinnock from the 80 's, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but must develop a coherent strategy for cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr on BBC whose position was left vacant on Sunday.
His official position towards Europe is Corbyn what I'd call with indulgence.
He says that he would like to remain in an EU reform.
Most of those who do not agree with "anglicismul" conservatives could agree with that.
That said Hilary Benn, A but not a Bennite "Benn on the radio and TV this week, when the Scout from he struggled not to acknowledge that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as a Minister" in the shadows "on financial matters was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the ' 70s, when his father wrestled on TV to be unfair labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing function in cabinet.
His Hilary was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "under all circumstances"-his expression Benn-does not correspond with what he said McDonnell nor with what JC said colleagues and lawmakers in private meeting Monday night.
Whatever image it wishes to convey Corbyn-note, has sensitized and me-messages remains important in the age of television, and in particular into the vortex of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
Is it fair to not be given Cameron's a favor in Europe, allowing him to get good support for labour in the campaign for the referendum, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the fallacy of McDonnell and his Corbyin regarding EU membership-in line with their past anti-capitalist-no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dizidenților for the which narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case concerning the sofismului NATO-Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not make campaign-foreign diplomats to surrender will be obliged to try to understand.
Why should waste his political capital Paris or Berlin-and there are suspicioși voters-for concessions in relation to the United Kingdom when everything could be useless?
The United States is already quite disenchanted tied to poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a Conservative Government that cuts costs, as I recalled the launch of British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
The experts are critical public health Department decision in England concerning electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, government agency claims that electronic cigarettes are with 95% less hazardous than cigarette smoking have resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with ties to the tobacco industry.
Specialists in editorial team of the journal British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined in criticizing the Lancet publication of evidence used by the Department of public health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE has published the report "reference" last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence."
Several researchers have, however, put in doubt ruggedness and data showed the finger towards the close link between certain experts and tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the Lancet medical journal has attacked "extraordinarily fragile" which he founded PHE main conclusion.
Two other scholars who write in BMJ have questioned their claims and substantiation "on solid ground or on sand moving."
Martin McKee, Professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "a fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that it is expected that claims that PHE "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are with 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In reality, only one meeting attended by 12 people has led to the development of a model for the analysis of multiple-criteria decision (MCDA) to summarise their opinions regarding the negative effects associated with various products that contain nicotine; the results of this meeting were summarized in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said that one of or the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss, about whose executive director was told that he would have received in the past funding from British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
It also validated the accreditation in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting said the funding received from a manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not about financing that there are reports that he had received it from the company producing cigarettes and tobacco, Philip Morris International.
No arguments have been provided on the basis of which the Panel members were selected, however, among them include several "prominent" in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declared in the paper industry funding.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of Department, also of tobacco control within the PHE.
Research work developed by mușamalizează group "convincingly" that "lacks solid evidence concerning the harmful effect on most of the products according to the majority of the criteria," said McKee and Capewell.
However, the report does not mention PHE none of these ties or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said claims that PHE "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes constitutes a factor which encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of the Department of health within the PHE, declares that it has in the past responded to claims from the BMJ.
He said: "electronic Cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of the two people who smoked the whole life loses his life because of this flaw.
All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes to health are minor in comparison, however, we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public concerning information and those which do not arise from the evidence, particularly considering the high degree of public confusion about the dangers relative compared to tobacco.
Annually, about 80000 people lose their life because of a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs borne by the national health system because smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Expressing clear current evidence-namely that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not risk-free, they are just a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking-we fulfill your duty.

Violinist David Grimal: In Bach's era there were no tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked there, and artists representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a project less usual, downright "weird", as he himself says, Les Dissonances an orchestra made up of international soloists and instrumentalists, who plays a symphonic repertoire without a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year with two performances of the Enescu Festival: a performance on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, founder of the Orchestra, and one Monday, when in the foreground was cellist Xavier Phillips works by Enescu being at your disposal.
Both performances, performed on stage, the audience showed Athenaeum another way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, at that time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there is no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, on the one hand the musicians need an education to become singers, either to become interpreters in an orchestra-speak lie and not songwriters.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
They themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, to the public, the whole fetisizarea musical focuses on conducting.
And so, business, music industry, does its marketing.
Therefore, not to mention about the music.
So, if we look at this world, on the one hand we have the skilled labour, which is stupid, and an audience that may not listen, but you have to look, and what is stupid ", considering David Grimal.
The violinist says that this change in the way that makes the music came in the wake of "musical deceptiilor" of his career as a soloist.
I was as an athlete at the high level that had to do the same exercise in world with different orchestras, to earn money and to bring money and the music industry.
In 10 years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because they no longer find creativity and human brotherhood in this system.
So, I have never found any sense to continue on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happens in 2004, and at that time no one was doing it without a conductor: "the musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
"How do you imagine doing marketing with a collective of musicians in which there is no ego?" ask the artist.
David Grimal admits that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra does not depend on the success of this project for living.
In 10 years of existence as a whole, the lack of a conductor has not been proven to be a hindrance in the musical Act: "curiously, as we play a repertoire, the more complex it seems simpler, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the work, and not just in the role," adding that Grimal, support the Sunday show "I was 74 of conductors on the stage".
In his opinion the Enescu Festival Grimal, is a "very brave", precisely because of the invited and Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where there are the greatest orchestras in the world that plays and 3 times per day, and in the midst of these orchestras have you ever invited this group and odd".
In a temple of the orchestral tradition, as well as Enescu Festival is, there are interests and place for something different, that breaks barriers.
Talking about the work of Ecob, violinist acknowledges that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so didn't need a special approach when he introduced works by Enescu in repertoire.
Grimal notes that the music of Enescu is very instinctiva, but that happens when we speak of George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there used to be a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal advocate changing the manner in which classical musical education, considering that "being a musician, as it is organized today, has an odor of death" and that "the future of music represents music itself."
We don't need to make round the world 5 times a year if you don't serve anything.
In Bach's era there were no tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked there were artists and commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, release, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as it is done in the service of the music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffer, no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal has given the example of Romanian products before and post accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before you enter into the EU, had good meat and vegetable".
To enter the EU had to adopt sanitary laws which are not good for vegetables and meat.
Manufacturing and agriculture have come to service supermarkets, as it happens, and in France.
With music, the same thing happens, it is the same logic.
Les Dissonances make tomatoes can not really beautiful, but when you cut the tomatoes are true.
In an ideal world, you would like this music to return to the Center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system to understand that music doesn't need to be sold, but it needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider-as do the Chinese, Koreans, Japanese-like Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, I revert his learning in school, I reintroduce the concerts on television and through this education would no longer be needed to sell the musical number," believes Grimal.
Certainly, there are things in the classical musical education which remain very anti-communist, it's everywhere, it's something very militarized.
Depends on the discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or you will get caught by a musician who plays an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if you want to train a soldier (education-URn.red.) must be in some way, if you want to get caught by a musician, is something else.
After parearea you, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? "asks the smiling French artist.
Grimal looks like, for artists, the reward of a different kind of making music just comes from coping with this status of "soldier", coping with what they think are their limits ":" discover the Musicians at one particular moment as there are soldiers, and after the concert come out smiling. "
David Grimal has spoken about the project or musical, and about his vision of music and artist in the "Festival of ideas", a discussion with the audience, organized within the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Institute Romania.

The company said it still expects to increase earnings in relation to previous year as a result of reducing costs, higher revenues and develop trade online.
President and ceo Fred Smith said in a statement that "the company is facing an economic situation considerably weaker than expected, particularly in terms of global production and trade."
Hiring plans during the holidays were announced a day after competitor UPS said it plans to hire additional 90,000-95,000 workers, about the same number of job opportunities that we did last year.
In the second quarter that ended august 31, FedEx earned $ 692 million, 6 percent more than the previous year.

But the explosion in online shopping has gone FedEx Ground Division results.

Tuesdays at closing 11 percent declined from the level of year and 17% from the record peak recorded on June 11.
The most anticipated encounters in recent years, people in charge of policy-making within the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week in a Honduran mahogany tables with 27 to decide whether the time has come to increase a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, from one end of the lobby of the Central Bank meetings, will întrezări a mural of the United States.
The map is intended to recall that Janet l. Yellen, the Fed Chairman, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double load on the part of Congress to maximize the occupancy rate of the labour force in the us and maintain price stability.
However, the great depression, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is an unwritten third task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the X factor in a decision too difficult to predict which will be announced Tuesday, and that will determine whether the u.s. economy is ready to be dezbărată by the unprecedented incentive offered by short-term interest rate to nearly zero in force starting in late 2008.
Even though the majority of data indicates a growing economy strong, recent turmoil on global financial markets could scare off Fed officials already cautious towards adding volatilității reference rate by increasing the federal funds-even with only one-quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and the main issues that we will follow," said Lindsey Piegza, an economist m. Chief at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I think, however, that if they would seek an excuse not to increase interest rates, uncertainty in world market growth is sufficient to give them arguments to wait," he said.
There is no consensus with respect to the decision on who would get Fed, it itself causing instability on financial markets.
About half of the economists questioned recently by Bloomberg anticipated a rise in interest rates this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to defer, as a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is just 30%.
This would indicate a decline on the stock exchange if the Fed increases interest rates, unless those who draw up policies that would alleviate the coup and pledged that it would take long until the next increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, up at 16599.85.
The boom was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep interest rates steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising that the Fed's interest rate to rise to this moment," said Lonski.
If Fed policymakers would do this, "should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on the financial markets".
Other experts have said that an interest rate increase would calm financial markets as it would remove uncertainty regarding the time that the Fed will act.
With just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to grow duck with 0.25% this month, the first small step toward tightening monetary conditions slowly which would confirm the recovery force US.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that it expected an increase in interest rates this year despite objections raised by Liberals that would take more than economic progress.
Although job creation has slowed in august, labour market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years, and close to the level of interest of the Fed as the total employment of the labour force.
Earnings have presented signs of growth.
And while inflation has continued to not hit the target on an annual basis of the Central Bank, the Fed's policymakers also said that a key reason has been the temporary effect of flying oil prices slump.
The economy "can cope at higher rates and needs them, given the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets worldwide have begun to enter into fibrillation by the end of this month, after China and devalued the currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 16 per cent below the record peak reached in may, as investors feared that the slowing of the Chinese economy will drag down world growth.
The market somewhat this month, run regular Dow is now about 10% below the peak in May.
For Fed policymakers, market turmoil adds to the complex calculation of the moment of raising interest rates.
"What happened in the financial markets and weakening the Chinese news about the economy in recent weeks, would be firmer during the meeting," said Stephen d. Oliner, a researcher with experience within the UCLA Jordan Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now, he expects they will wait at least a month to manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty of what will be the impact on the us economy and almost did not have data on which to base subsequent events in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of Edf, so that should not be taken into account in decision-making.
However, in reality, the Fed became the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the Central Bank's influence has been huge.
The mere hint of then-Chairman, Ben s. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "narrow" monetary expansion triggered earthquake on global markets.
In a world in which markets and economies are in tandem with increasingly longer, it is expected that Fed officials not only to monitor the progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the Department of global business strategy for managing welfare Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that "the Fed has a history of reacting to changes of oversized financial markets that seem to have no relation to economic grounds."
Lacker, voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, the body with decision-making role and supported an increase in the interest rate, offered as an example the decisions in 1998-99.
A financial crisis that has battered Asia has prompted the Fed to cut the rate of 0.75% reference in three meetings, "despite the implications of limited identification for the development of the U.S.," said Lacker.
A year later, Fed officials came upon the respective decreases.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability in the first place only in the event of major crises such as the earthquake in the market since 2008, "said Adam s. Posen, a former member of the Commission for determining the interest rate within the Bank of England.
The last hectic period does not amount nowhere near that level, he said.
"Certainly we don't want to get into the situation we were afraid of a rise in interest rates because they were upset the markets," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Federal Reserve Act still holds double mandate and did not mention the financial stability and, until it will change anything in that respect, I don't think we should take action prematurely.

Weight reduction surgery could be useful in the case of diabetics with slight obesity
The benefits of weight reduction in people with obesity, with type 2 diabetes might maintain for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetes with obesity easy live longer after surgical intervention for weight loss than those who follow nechirurgicale treatments.
"It is necessary to centralize data on mortality," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, also known as Bariatric Surgery, employ various methods to decrease stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limits the body's ability to absorb food.
Along the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2, but most studies have been conducted on persons with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, it is considered normal range 18.5-24.9.
BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the Hospital General Min-Sheng from Taiwan have used data collected in 2007 after a trial in which compares two types of Bariatric Surgery-gastric bypass and sleeve-gastrectomie in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with obesity.
BMI average in people who have undergone surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year as part of the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who have received nechirurgicale treatments against diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes was cured completely from 36% to 28% and partially.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was cured completely from just 1% and partly just 2% of the subjects.
In addition, control blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL "bad" cholesterol "were generally more favourable in the surgical group," concluded the authors.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose level over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c of less than 7%.
After surgical intervention, the average level of hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the group treated by medical methods has been maintained at about 8%.
But this "glycemic control," reflected improved-enhanced levels of hemoglobin A1c — have reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to Chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the results of environments associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with gastrectomie in the group, the group with sleeve surgery bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 towards 14.2 kg), has registered considerable decreases in the value of most IMC (7.4 towards 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% from 2,1%) and have a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% from 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study done on people with high weight from Sweden that surgical intervention extends life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona School of medicine-Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery showed about 29% probability of dying after 15 years, compared with a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study has not shown a benefit in survival in patients who have undergone surgery, Blackstone said he was an optimist looking for people with BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the point where this is critical, because it asserts that this surgery is safe in the group with lower BMI" without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start to take seriously the weight then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we're too far until we urge people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once you have completed these genetic modifications they have shorted them predispunându bodies to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely hard to return to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe"-Dalai Lama-RT news
Europe would not be able to get all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current crisis situation of refugees is in the Middle East.
The tibetan Buddhist leader has sent an appeal to put an end to the violence the parent countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current issue of the crisis of refugees in the speech that he delivered at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion from Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies at the beginning of his 10-day visit in the United Kingdom.
He said that, in the present situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the face of the interests of each nation and each continent.
Also pointed out that, while admirable, the response of the countries of Western Europe to the crisis of refugees is inadequate to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama has praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he pointed out that it is only a temporary solution.
"It's wonderful caring for thousands of refugees, but we need to think at the same time the long-term solutions to bring peace and development, in particular through candid education in Muslim countries," he stressed.
In fact, we must think of ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The force did not resolve these problems never ", he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented about George Bush's actions after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, asserting that violent response on the part of the US has generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 11 September, we sent condolences in a letter to President Bush, and i told him to sort out this problem without resorting to violence.
I know that his motives were strong but had used force and generated unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.

Why are witness to an execution in Oklahoma
During the day today, with the exception of a late intervention legal, I'll look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If this happens, and I hope that it doesn't happen, I'll just sit in a room for observers of the execution of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and I'll see how Richard Glossip is executed through the administration of lethal injection.
Asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation came the first time in January, through to the one his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As you approach the day in question, I îngrozește the idea.
So, what to do?
I agreed because I thought it is a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
Would provide a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because usually applications exceed the number of seats available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for representatives of the press from 12 to five.
Those elected will concern the implementation with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would stand next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip, Additionally I have developed my own relation to it along the telephone conversation and a visit that lasted two hours and a half.
I love the guy.
Often we laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say they can't be witness and journalist, so I will let you have to me a jot down and a pen to record what they see.
You have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter that I compromise impartiality.
Here's lesson.
Tells the story of deținutului as she wants it, gain access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that "it could have been better formula", but is still of the opinion that what's wrong.
Richard Glossip did not agree with some of the things you've said and I've written.
I don't tell you what to write, and I wouldn't do it if I would ask.
I said that I can remove it from the list of witnesses.
But now she wants to be an international report to write about the topic.
He believes that if he dies, the publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be next to me.
If you want to learn more about the event, listen to a series of multimedia files that you have made.
I won't come back here for all the details.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard is innocent Glossip.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese makes it guilty of complicity.
But I think that is very likely to not be guilty of murder.
I believe with certainty that there were no sufficient evidence to warrant the death penalty.
I think that his execution is wrong.
And I'll look at the dying from this perspective.
I can't pretend that I'm totally objective.
To do this, you can read articles by other reporters.
From me you will learn what it is like to watch a man that you like dying needlessly.
Peter Moody claims that stewarzii tried to spy on him and threatening to retire from racing
Peter Moody said the stewarzii Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy to his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the races.
Launched an attack against stewarzilor and the integrity of the Racing Department, asserting that they carried out a personal campaign against him, the straw that filled the Cup being the removal of Lady Sheila from the race due to a treatment administered on race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media that has always tried to do what is best for racing and that is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result in the test for cobalt, for his Lidari that has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed the words referring to declarations about spies and did not want to resemble "the Fox which did not reach the grapes."
"I was not going to say anything related to that aspect and I kept quiet for a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration that high răbufnește way as everything at once," said Moody.
It is known that continued.
Sometimes reacționezi and consequences must, and I stands will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I will go home and I will sleep peacefully.
I want to go with your head up and I wish that the owners with whom they cooperate to see that I will strive to give them all the best.
From the moment they begin to believe that it happens, should I to work as trainer.
At that time you will need to think about what I'll do with my certification.
Previously, Moody's had thrown the bomb in an interview for racing.com, in which he declared that the integrity of the Department tried to pry into the stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart stood in a room next to a man whose name I'll tell if I am asked, and have offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the work there," said Moody's for Racing.com.
Obvious that I consider a trișor.
If this is the case, then you should give all its resignation because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of RVL, David Moodie, Chairman of RVL and Bernard Saundry, Executive Director, the current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and I know today.
You would think that it's something personal?
Is it necessary that the RVL begin to have backbone and can draw the people outside trainers for what is happening in the industry?
I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe so I see others.
Maybe I should get the licence and to give myself to the side and I don't have any doubts that the statements they make now could cause you to think about this possibility.
We arrived at the point where I don't care and that saddens me.
Saddens me very hard.
I'll put the pressure on, and I will cause you to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can go.
Trainer's frustration grew with the lengthy investigation on testing the cobalt has been implicated Lidari and elimination led him to assert that they could "put their license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of champion unbeaten Black Caviar, has labeled the treatment rule the day as "ridiculous" after it has been applied to the feet of the horse a mud or clay poultice, which violates the rules.
Violating the rules of racing.
Should I take full responsibility for this, "he says.
One of my employees i inadvertently put mud on foot.
It would have to happen last night.
It would have to happen yesterday, what happened was, and.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody's could be disqualified for three months for treatment the day consisting of the application of cataplasmei for which stewarzii have opened an investigation.
Is a joke.
People who make these rules I don't know anything about horses.
"We understand all the rules but it has gone too far," said Moody.

Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy, answering accusations of opponents in wrestling.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy, called criticism of the tactics used by plating his team as "skewed subjects" raised two main favorites from the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach, Trent Robinson said the referees allowed players from the Storm to "get to grips" team in the match won in the final jumping qualifier Storm played Friday evening at Sydney.
The coach of the Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made a slight reference to the Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match with North Queensland Cowboys, played Saturday night, when he called the match a "demonstration" of rugby league and said that the two teams from Queensland is not too good at wrestling.
Bellamy has leapt to the defence of the tactics his team tackled plating and said the players simply focused on "contact" when placau.
Bellamy says he has gained confidence after two notable coaches i criticized the team, meaning that they were worried that the Storm will defeat.
"Things don't stop here-I've not heard Trent Robinson to complain about wrestling when we were beaten with the score 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that I haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, provided just that in the last six weeks I really put emphasis on contacts in such an attractive and I have changed the situation.
Trent is in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so that it is not normal to lose and it was a shock to him.
Cute as always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy has contradicted the idea of Bennett to "liven up" football, reminding them of his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the Championship in 2010 playing football "boring".
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued opinion comparing and Saturday evening with our game on Friday evening and talked about how exciting was the game, "said Bellamy.
I recall that, in 2010, St George has received criticism for being a boring team and Wayne stated that you're not interested nor as black under nails.
But now he has a team that can play what I considered to be exciting football, mainly due to the fast mijlocașilor young.
This genre of game do you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play-not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they assert these things because they are somewhat tied the match worried us.
Now six weeks it likely came to us when it came to important matches.
Bellamy has also removed the fact that the match between the Storm and the Roosters was a stiffer competition linked to score compared to the match between the Broncos and Cowboys.
Match those of the Broncos was probably a good match, I've not yet seen, how was your score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18 in our game there were two tests, that means thrilling game?
Or exciting means to make breaks and not flagging?
For me are planes.
If you are talking about us, it means that at some point i may encounter.
Free storm this weekend because they have earned the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys, Cronulla Sharks, with either in the preliminary rounds of the finals next Saturday at AAMI Park, with tickets on sale starting next Tuesday morning.

FriendsFest: comedy series that taught important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young males reaching the tip of the last 15 years.
In 2013, the suicide he was the main cause of death in women aged 20-45 years in the United Kingdom, and the remains of three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the campaign against the unfortunate life (Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)) has designated the year 2015 as the year of the man, wanting to put in question the culture which discourages men ask for help when they need it.
Friendship stands in the center of the fight by the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2,000 high school students presenting symptoms of depression has concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough many friends "with a healthy alternative available," his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of friends in good health mentally reduced to half the probability of occurrence of mental disorders.
Of course, because friendship to take effect, it must firstly be accessible.
In this age of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style and not on substance, the immediate response often has priority before contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a powerful figures open to fun and success, even though in reality it is the isolation that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call this extrinsic values; money, social status, all the intrinsic values — our desire for personal development and friendship-which affects our mental health more deeply.

The beauty of the series was that Ayu has turned his attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined in the workplace but also of his own personality, which he showed by interact as friends.
His humor frequently asked îmbrățișărilor of Joey and Chandler, the times when looking at football in comfortable armchairs and Ross's passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men may be associated with this case, even if often keep out to explore fully the sentiments.
As explained to me a social worker: "my role to listen to people with suicidal tendency and depressed and showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make the difference."
Often, people turn to we don't feel able to talk with friends.
The old adage you handle alone is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that come to my mind when I try to offer more psychological mechanisms of adaptation in the long term.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
No matter how much help outside, objective intervention, through the phone, people arrived in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you participate in this weekend to FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with full playback of plateaus of shooting to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends over a coffee in Central Perk.

Di Maria to score and help to give Malmo PSG aside
Angel Di Maria Blaise Matuidi celebrates along with Edinson Cavani and after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG to win in front of Swedish team Malmo.
Further we present a chronicle of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani made his duty, Paris Saint-Germain since series of group matches of the Champions League with a 2-0 victory against soothing Malmo in the match played Tuesday on the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after the start of his debut match in the Champions League, PSG team bringing the champions of France in advantage although they missed out on a number of occasions before the advantage with goal by Cavani in the minute 61.
In Group A along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, will need a strong start against Swedish champions since the French team's goal is not just to qualify for the last 16 but also an improvement in the journey towards the quarter-finals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, coached by Laurent Blanc were far from a perfect tableau, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who has squandered the opportunity for goal after which it was replaced by the hometown team, and the Club at which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or on the go in the Champions League, so the 2-0 victory they create problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference towards the next finalist, even if there are still issues to be perfecționăm along the season," said Blanc.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to live up to and I did, although I'm sorry that I haven't been able to give one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic came back after being injured in one of three changes to the team from Paris, with a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux achieved in League 1 over the weekend, but Di Maria took the limelight in the 87th minute.
Last month, when he was transferred from Manchester United, midfielder of the Argentine playmaker was named the man who will lead PSG to the next level in Europe and showed this when he shot out the care of Marco Verratti behind his defence Malmo before șuteze Johan Wiland, incredibly over in the right corner in the gate.
But if you wait for someone like PSG clinch victory fingers, banging they were disappointed.
Australia, who defeated Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine teams, the holders with a defense of five people and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack has not been impressive, with the exception of Nikola Djurdjic shot past the post in the 87th minute Kevin Trapp 34.
In contrast, PSG players have slowed down the pace a few times, giving some passing unnecessary and nefinalizând interventions, including Ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five tests only in the first half, and was then replaced by Cavani even after restarts.
Ibrahimovic has proved more skillful but in support of his colleagues, his care being the Di Maria sent a close range shot deflected by Wiland in 52 carries over.
The second goal was scored in a final after one hour has elapsed from the match due to his uruguayanul Cavani, who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic cared from Maxwell's centering.
This gap has eliminated the hopes of the Malmo that will rebalance the score and only a superb stop of his remote Wiland to dismiss David Luiz has kept the final score before Ezequiel Lavezzi new intratului to cancel a goal in extra time.
The Norwegian team coach from Malmo, the Age company Hareide said later that PSG were a class above and that "Last game I've played in the Champions League came in December last year."
Since then, I've only played in the League from Sweden, which does not amount to the same level.
Qualifications alone are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They made an excellent game.

Ponta accused broadside uncontrolled and irrational statements
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto harshly condemned on Wednesday morning, Prime Minister roman Victor Ponta affirmations that RTD policies from Hungary, there are "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee '.
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost self-control and his irrational statements, hurting all over Hungary," Hungarian Foreign Minister conveyed in a press release.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrolled broadside.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he lost total support in internal politics from Romania," added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a posting Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that wants to attract attention and to sanctioneze behavior of high government officials, who, in his opinion, "are an embarrassment for the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not wish to respond to the challenges coming from some government representatives.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and the attitudes of anti-Semitism, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the crisis of refugees ", said Ponta.
The Prime Minister added that the novel is committed to rational and sustainable solutions in the case of refugees, describing the crisis as brutalitatile and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, laws, prisons and brutality will definitely not solve the problem-it just will look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, political decision-makers are no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries in which these refugees fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, in particular in the superiority of European values-what we see in the last few days in Hungary is in total contradiction with just these objectives and values!", said the Chief Executive.
Earlier Tuesday, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, has described as "outright lies" to the Premier's remarks roman Victor Ponta about managing by Hungary of the crisis of refugees, saying that such statements are inappropriate for a leader of the 21st century, according to MTI.
Hungarian diplomacy Chief said Tuesday, and that "extremist remarks and lying" of Prime Minister Rafiq related internal policy crisis from Romania and noted that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto was referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've said and always say is that I am against xenophobic speeches the idea to close the borders, as all who come are some terrorists, are nonsense from the middle ages and I'm totally opposed to this approach.
If we receive more and more, you'll receive the problem is our logistics capability to treat those people as people, not how to treat our neighbors, with his bat and with inseriatul.
"With this I do not agree," said Chief Executive roman, in a press conference in Abu Dhabi.
All Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Hungary decided to start preparations for enlargement on the border with Romania of the fence you build on the border with Serbia, to cope with any changes to the route used by migrants.
Subsequently, Prime-Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision of raising a fence near does not solve the problem of the refugees and "brings out Hungary in Europe '.
What connection exists between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the crane from Mecca
Saudi authorities have announced that the giant Saudi Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partly responsible" for the collapse of a crane on Friday on the great mosque at Mecca, accident in which 107 people died.
According to a Commission of investigation, the company had not "respected safety norms", according to press agency Arabia (SPA), reports the BBC.
The directors of the company have received the ban to leave the country until the completion of the investigations in this case.
The company will also be excluded from public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by the father of Osama bin Laden in the wake of 80 years, and is currently led by the former terrorist leader's brother, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years in the expansion of Large Mosques, to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night, during a storm, when a crane perhaps imbalanced powerful gusts of wind, crashed on the eastern side of the roof of the Great Mosque at Mecca.
Following the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
As they closed H mouth appellants
Considered by many the greatest footballer in history, Bero was tagged after retirement, as a weak may not be able to achieve performances and new posture.
After the unfortunate experience at national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, after a year in the role of coach in the future, the team that you patronise.
After a one-year fix from taking over the team, King has demonstrated that it is able to transform a team struggling to save from relegation in the top one.
Thus, after one year, he recorded with Hagi, 16 WINS, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
Balance is one of the top teams, which it beat in the European cups.
Things took a turn and the best for the future of this season, as the team reached the second place in the League with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future has the best attack in the League with 20 goals (tied with Astra), more than double than the star.
On the other hand, even if it has brought to the team several players experienced, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young, and lately the home team appeared names like Ibarra H or Haas.
The Club's policy has made the team watched for foreign teams, such as Hagi has sold in this summer of 1.5 million euros-Ibarra H (Fiorentina-EUR 1 million) and Alexander Duane (Bari-500 thousand euros).
Alongside Future Star, is the only team in the League profitable 1, according to data from the trade register.
The refugees crisis, Romania has played up to now as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't claim to be treated as the seventh EU country.
Big countries coming up with solutions for the entire EU, says Ann Gale, a member of the governing College of the Roman Centre of European policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Galante showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the means of law enforcement will not work easily in this crisis: "Can we doubt towards the quality values that come with these people."
But are the masses who have started and we cannot turn back history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt ourselves better and to adapt them to the new.
According to Galante, we are in an extremely emotional moment, in which politicians feel the need to show his muscles.
After that he will go, the Europeans will not be willing to give up free traffic, but the rules should be changed in the Schengen space: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the situation now."
Where we are in crisis after this JAI Council of refugees which, in fact, has not solved anything?
It is clear that what the President agreed with Donald Tusk have not wanted to force a vote in the Council.
All forecasts said that they had the necessary votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty in principle apply unanimitatii JAI and any State could block any decision.
Therefore, things were less integrated into the field of Justice and Home Affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure is applied, what has the initiative, and the Council approve the majority of 55% of Member States, i.e. 16, represent 65% of the EU population.
The calculations were saying that there were votes.
But they didn't want to go forward.
Because it is a sensitive matter, rejection reactions have occurred even in Germany against the opening policy of Chancellor Merkel and have not wanted to appear in many countries as a reaction of "EU migrants send us head on."
Delayed in this way, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for Schengen and governance we will witness the great changes there in the next period.
So quotas have not really been abolished, but the subject was only allowed to be more cool?
Yes, on the other hand, speaks of a greater involvement of the Frontex Agency in the management of the external borders, which means a change from individual responsibility to members who are external to the Schengen border to community agencies responsibility.
Greece's border with Turkey border with Germany is also Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the old Schengen system limits.
Maybe they will give up the principle of Dublin, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the State in which they enter the first time, because it's not sustainable.
If Greece capoteaza, you can't tell that it's the job of Greece.
The problem is the commune.
Precisely because the problem is common, it is possible a resolution without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, the resulting effort of receipt?
Nobody knows exactly how it will work, if quotas will reach them.
Because it remains a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come in Romania or in Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I don't think it will grab the European States to take up migrants: you go in country X or country Y.
You probably will get some unique filtration centres, in Greece or in Turkey, where to process asylum applications.
They are working on solutions.
But the problem does not have a simple solution.
There are countries who have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are countries with no experience, like Romania, where migrants will enhance the current problem of racism and xenophobia.
The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, in precarious camps and who had just started to go to Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have got to go, it's hard winter Mediterranean, but we expect next year to an even bigger wave can.
What do we do with these people?
My forecast is that we will get used to this problem, we look so catastrophic in terms of the media.
Talking of countries experienced smaller or larger.
It seems that there is no place where she managed really integrating large groups coming from a extraeuropeana culture?
Watch the magrebieni in France, the Turks in Germany, they are all enclavizati.
I wouldn't go towards radical statements.
Sure that their integration is even more difficult than in the case of other waves of migration, but that does not mean that we do not integrate at all.
He remained a part neintegrata that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in the United Kingdom.
But it means the sheer politiensti will not work.
To create a fortress Europe it's illusory.
You have walked the mechanisms of integration into the European societies.
There were some mistakes.
We must be more demanding.
To ask these people to learn, to try to take over the values, not to remain with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family through marriages of convenience.
But the impending problem should be separate to these people's long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in integrating long-term doesn't mean you have to look at her cum drowns in Mediterranean.
Can we doubt towards the quality values that come with these people.
And if there will be an intervention in Syria, which does not believe, does not mean that it will remake country overnight, and you can take you back.
To defend the solutions, we see the fortresses on the European continent.
Borders were closed, rises, reintroduced border controls within the Schengen space.
Is the european project in jeopardy?
The european project as such, Schengen space as it was built, Yes.
It was built quite minimal and aranjand rules so that the pressure was too great on countries in which put his foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean we circulam free from colo colo, but each with his problems.
In the face of such a wave cannot be so, because some countries do not face.
When there are also waves of emotion, politicians will look like they are doing something, but in the long run doesn't change much.
After the bombings in France we do not have a more draconian anti terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a tidal wave of public emotion that occurs in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to another that you can't make decisions based on them.
We have a lot of bellicose statements verbosity, many of the politicians who find themselves under pressure at home to be as I knew them.
And, then, if the child you dramatically Phillips public opinion in Turkey and it moves.
After passing public emotion, we will get back to why I created this space, this freedom of movement not only for humans but also for goods.
This is the only real market.
And I don't think the Europeans will give up this principle of libertatatii of movement.
As will be other rules is different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the situation now.
As Romania has played so far in this crisis?
As a small country that believes that if you pull the cap off his eyes and ears, stop their theme disappears.
In the face of waves of migrants reality, you can choose to be part of the solution or to say that it's not your problem of small country.
Us that we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't claim to be treated as the seventh EU country.
You're not, not playing at the level of the big country.
Big countries coming up with solutions for the entire EU, good or bad, do not discuss their quality now.
So how did Poland.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will drop a lot.
The President can say that Johannis well I already entered.
So we go from despair to entrance a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter the Schengen as migrants to see us as the alternative route.
What does not mean that it is a reason not to enter into the Schengen area, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, Schengen and there will be, but turned in the sense in which external borders will become common, responsibility will be unique rules for acceptance of migrants, unique rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum rules unique to countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian President said that after Russia and has shifted attention on Syria in Ukraine has not killed anybody.
There is a link between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?
Russia has a lot of power frustrated.
She believes that to be the great power it means to incurci the Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, Yes, there's a connection.
Without the military effort and financial regime, perhaps as Assad's regime would have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to crash before the main opponent to be the Islamic State.
A couple of years has been a struggle between secular Assad regime and militiile and Muslim moderate, sustained by the Gulf countries and Westerners.
He then raised the Islamic State and now you don't know if you want that the Assad fall.
Russia could complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
She creates hotbeds of instability and chaos that you can close.
But you're great power only if you and the solutions.
The off-side is just a strategy to save time.
Probably Least expect to be offered, to press him on the buttons in order to resolve the situation.
The offers don't come because the world is not convinced that he is able to resolve in one way or another he created issues.
But I disagree with the theories that say that these people are motivated by an invisible hand.
Not we see a little more powerful than it is.
Image button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users were accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opus, the "Dislike".
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and Chief Executive of the company, announced on his account as this button will be available soon, reported the New York Times blog.
Zuckerberg said the button "Dislike" will look rather a shade of what feels like a user than a mere option.
However, the announcement raised the question that or Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wanted to avoid the times when someone post on account or an important event in the life of, and someone else will give "Dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billions of active accounts, have called for a long time to be able to express negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg has said that it is not very comfortable for people to "Like" some current events, as well as refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable hitting Like that posts" Facebook representative pointed out.
A new version button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
"There's already enough hate on Facebook and on social networks," commented Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where he was posted in article on the subject.
"I'll give ' Dislike ' button ' Dislike '," he noted.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, argued that there is nothing wrong with this, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, senior analyst at eMarketer social media company, said that it is hard to imagine that a single button can convey a range of negative emotions.
Furthermore, it supports the approaching election campaign in America, and the "Dislike" would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees have entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary has accepted only 70 migrants Tuesday, a handful of thousands come to the table in its southern border with Serbia, the Government Adviser announced Ganguly Bakondi.
Hungary declared a State of emergency earlier in the day in two counties along the border with Serbia because the refugee flow a primary point of border crossing and announcing that it would build a fence at its border with Romania, just remember the DPA.

The "new" headquarters of the County Council sits to crash.
Two builders insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, stand to take down because they were stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The headquarters of the County Council from Vasile Alecsandri Street will get to remove it yourself.
A year and a half when I should have completed the work of consolidation and refuncționalizare of the building works have not gotten any in half.
A final stage in epic building consumed a few days ago, when the National Board of review procedures (CNSC) dismissed a complaint that the company wanted to take over the contract for the realization of the project for technical works are executed.
The initial project was drawn up by HIS Romcatel Impex.
After the insolvency of the constructor and the interruption of the works have been commissioned negotiated procedures without prior publication of a contract notice with Impex company Romcatel, to update technical design, and then organized a new tender for the work.
"The negotiations have not been completed, however, under any form, saying that the proposed institution would be disadvantaged," summed up Timofciuc, Răzvan represented public relations within the CJ.
CJ's decision of direct negotiations was attacked in court by the Ngo Romcatel.
The Tribunal's invitation he sent the complaint to the CNSC, which dismissed it as delayed.
This does not mean, however, that CJ may start looking for another designer.
ImpEx Romcatel has the opportunity to have the decision reviewed by CNSC to the Court of appeal, it was not until after a final sentence of it may consider finding another designer.
Thus, the work of strengthening the building could be resumed at the earliest next year.
Our intention is to start the work as soon as possible.
In principle, technical project should not last long, but you have to arrive at the conclusion of a contract.
"We look forward to seeing if the decision of the CNSC will be attacked or not," said Timofciuc.
Works to strengthen the former headquarters of the Police permit at started in 2011.
The first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after the recall of 4.5 million works.
The invitation to tender, the contract was resumed being awarded for HIS Moldoconstruct.
The company went into insolvency, however, and this contract being terminated, after they had made payments of 1.5 million lei.
The works have been carried out so far at the rate of about 50%.
Initially, the consolidation works, refuncționalizare and garrets of buildings were valued at 7.7 million lei.

Iașul, made of laughter of a RATP and controllers folder.
Pățania a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iași to visit, but the trip ended with a promise.
After living experience nor I nor my wife no longer want to follow in your city ever.
Unwittingly, have been hit by erroneous information leaflets, RAPT and controllers nesimțirea, bonus, a fine "that says the law".
Wife arrived in Iași a few days ago, were staying in a hotel downtown and demanded tourist leaflets.
Have received and a folder in the past were RATP routes.
"Armed" with these maps, wife have visited Iașul.
But two days ago, the Copou Park, they wanted to reach Palas.
As it was not complaining with tickets in substation near Copou Park, they have relied on the information printed on the folder: can get ticket via SMS.
Not told anyone that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the folder, they climbed into a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on folder.
Unfortunately for her, she made her appearance a team of Auditors RATP.
They said that there is no service for 2 years and as it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
I KNOW where to what was written in the local press, I came with an evening before visiting the town?
I talked to the Auditors, I explained the situation, they said that they don't care, it's not their job.
The attitude was very sfidatoare.
They said that all they can do is to us a single output signal fine instead of 2 (one thousand and wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to spoil the day visited the gendarmerie stand and giving statements in there!", recounts.
In conclusion, the family has been amended due to erroneous information on the controllers folder, and which "have applied the law to the blood".
It's not fair, and I made a referral to the RATP for me to recover the money.
It's not about the money, I'm not exaggerating, but the idea is that I felt cheated.
Bad luck for rapists in Vaslui.
Had the accident and remained in remand
Process the seven rapists of Vaslui moved yesterday, the Court of appeal.
Romanian nuclear physicists magistrates have judged the first term of the Court in a non-public meeting in which seven young men accused that have mocked a young woman of 18 years have asked to be placed in custody.
Prior to the commencement of the trial, one of the judges who had been assigned to Romanian nuclear physicists dossier Amrizal, filed an application to abstain, which was admitted by his colleagues from the Court.
The magistrate he served until this summer at the Tribunal, where he was the President of the Criminal Division, and he was the one who, on April 9, has admitted a complaint made by four of the defendants, placing them under house arrest.
Currently, the dossier is judged by a panel of magistrates Mabee Maher and Geta S.
Previously, the files had formulated an abstention and judge Dan Anton, because his daughter is in a cohabiting relationship with one of our lawyers rapists.
The two judges have decided that the rapists of Vaslui to remain in remand.
Young people remain imprisoned for at least 30 days, when judges will rediscuta the possibility of their implementation.
The next term of the Court will be held at Iași Court of appeal on October 6.
Before arriving at Iași Court of appeal, which were transported with duba rapists from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the district in 1840, in Iași.
Iveco van were transported with the seven rapists struck a Volkswagen car that split off, and find yourself Singing the driver tried to swerve to the left.
Duba circulates from the end in 1840.
The machine came in Iași on here because of the Prison Administration employees preferred route from Iași, Vaslui at the Stalls, then on the road.
They have shortened so the road a few kilometers.
Immediately after impact, arestaților escort called another transport to take inmates.
Soon, the site of the accident was sent to a Maximum Safety at the prison, which took seven prisoners and had them transported to the Court of appeal.
Following the accident, none of the arrested men was injured.
In order to transfer to the other van, the guards have surrounded the back of machine, and arestații came in, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported since Police drivers of the two vehicles have been understood in terms of damage to amicably must be paid," said Chief Commissioner Elizabeth Molloy of the IPJ.
The great migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
But Europe?
A saying from the start, clearly and bluntly: neither of those 7000 refugees which should and must naturalizeze Romania represents, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge in comparison to the Romanian Government's ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest in amount of around 1500 souls, we exceed by far the good intentions of the European Union expressed solidarity with in recent months.
Surely, even if those migrants will accept to settle in our municipalities opportunities to integrate rapidly into the Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I am convinced that they will be the first-and will lose patience.
Of Parazitat underworld and paralyzed by a political class venală, the Romanian State proves impotent in all areas.
Inability to integrate Roma is just a trivial example.
In addition, the Governments of every color were not able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, ensuring a decent health care to gather dirt on the street to create paid jobs honorably or retain their own young generation at home.
Why would determine the refugees in another country from which it runs away?
But what is particularly astonishing produces a lot of hypocrisy with which it dealt with such a crisis.
We stumbled over the first fățărnicia war mongering of the powerful States of the EU, which give evidence of extreme generosity when it comes to share troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the hypocrisy of Romanians fearful that, despite the millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet support the other-the other language, the other religion, other blood.
Probably afraid not to steal any being.
Finally, there is a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, while alleging that the ground war just the horrors of departure does not support destination other than exodus Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrians, while in Pakistan it is not war.
Also how simplistic it is analysed the crisis can only be picked up in derision.
Causes must be eliminated, argue some, relying strictly on political correctness, Heaven alone and investment for countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania it's peace and even, once in a while, something foreign capital in the national economy-but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians to leave their country every year.
Why do they leave?
In this crisis, European Union we were revealed as a construction anchilozată, divided and exceeded.
Deplângeam the fact that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but that neither the EU does not have any plan for the future.
And improvizațiile and threats do not help.
Then, what more the EU uses if the only advantage which they enjoyed the right of Romanians free circulation could not be put into question due to waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At one point, the war in Syria ends.
No crisis of migrants however.
In the following decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not, nor will ever be ready for what will follow.

Two frățiori from Transylvania have swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two children of 9 years, respectively from 11 years seniority, Tomești, have swallowed several pills of Diazepam.
They found the pills in the House and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother following a treatment, and medicines have not been hidden.
The children were taken to the emergency hospital "St. Mary" in Iași.
They are in stable condition, doctors say.
Exclusive: a meeting that break the heart.
The 20-year-old received a courageous: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear circumstances, in the 1990s, when he was only two months of life, little, bolnăvioară, and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family from Italy in the same year in which the adoption was loosely governed, a young ieșeancă, now a blonde girl, beautiful, day before yesterday was reunited with her biological parents in Iași, from a village of the County After nearly two decades in which no one knew anything.
Casey will fulfill these days to 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo were thought to give their beloved daughter a present amazing and brave: a visit in Romania, Iași, to knowing the background blurry.
"Ziarul de Iasi", who witnessed the search efforts of the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, he witnessed at these meetings that basically you break my heart.
The account to reporters moments, emotions, reactions of those involved, declarations are downright moving and overwhelming.
Crinei story starts 20 years now in Ruginoasa, while at the same time have only two months.
Then, due to health problems, the girl had to be hospitalized in a hospital in the city.
Home began to be friction between her parents, and her mother was forced to părărească home.
He decided to keep the girl, and me to send me back home.
He stopped, and since then I never knew anything.
"When I found out I was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls the sorrowful, the girl's biological mother.
Cassel was hospitalized along with her grandmother at the municipal hospital from Pașcani, while the girl's father, Costică B.a, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County, Romania.
Their lives had to separate permanently.
They were found at a hospital's Casey
After internment, Crinei's father went to work in another city, and he returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iași, and father, when he returned, did not find it.
I think that almost nine months had passed when the girl was in the hospital.
"A be thought it was abandoned, reportedly a granddaughter to the family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother was unable to come up with Casey in Iași, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one has been more interested in the fate of the child during this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection, which then gave it to the care Centre Bucium from placement.
There were years in which the abandonment and adoption were more loosely regulated in relation to today's Romania.
At the Center was found by Bucium Italian Salvatore and his wife, a Palermo couple wanting to have their child but couldn't.
Fell in love on the spot by blonduța Casey, and after some time it would relocate permanently with her in Italy.
Little had already almost two years ago, how long lasted the formalities of adoption.
When I saw it on, I felt like Casey it's our girl.
"If my wife would have given them life," says Joseph, adoptive father smiling while catching in the Palm of his hand, thin face.
In the country, Crinei, and parents swallowed continued separately, each on searches where he could.
The father asked authorities in Ruginoasa, but didn't get a reply where he could have his baby.
Police then announced that there may be deceased, but parents in Iași found out what happened with their true face.
When I searched it here, they said in court that she was away in Italy, Palermo.
And conditions to look for I have never had.
We prayed to God to be good.
I thought of it in all the years that have passed, but there were possibilities like to walk, to find.
"It's hard," we do share with tears in his eyes the biological mother of Crinei.
However, even if years have passed, the parents were not from Ruginoasa look.
In Italy, Salvatore and his wife face i explained where it comes from and that her past a link to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I had five or six years.
I reacted as a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to have my parents know from Romania," confesses proud Casey.
And her dream would become reality.
In March this year, the Chief Commissioner Gerardo Iannucci, Director of the Regional Center of preventive, assessment and Counselling service to Iași, was approached by an acquaintance from Italy who explained Mauricio's desire to find the biological family of the Crinei.
And the searches have only turned on from a name.
After requesting that we had from our partners in Italy, we have begun the first steps.
I only have one name, B.a, swallowed and then locality Ruginoasa.
Soon I had a town hall there, and I could ask if there are any names received through the commune.
Then they gave me a few indications, only that the person was not found and searched.
"It took up about a month until we find the girl's biological father," explains Chief Commissioner Gerardo Iannucci.
In total, more than three months after they have taken the authorities to find the sea and, especially since each have their residence in another commune.
We started the paperwork somewhere in March, and in June and July we completed the discussion and identification of biological parents.
"Then we have established that in September to be held a first meeting," added Jade Iannucci.
In the past weekend, and Costică and saw for the first time the girl lost the halls of the hospital in Iași, 20 years ago.
Father, emotional, barely able to master them, tears and the hands trembled incessantly.
I can hardly change a few words with others.
With one week before the meeting nor really able to sleep.
She was almost shaking.
"As you view the child after so many years, it's something," says a granddaughter, come with the Ace at Ruginoasa.
Crinei meeting with his mother and brother of the biological
In discussions with his face, to study at a University, rated from Italy, Costică B.a told him, among other things, that if he wants to return sometime at it, in a quiet village, to come: it could give some sheep, goats, like to find a boy from the village, and to încropească a household.
Mom and she moved, crying, and believes that hardly anything i may happen to her.
I am very emotional.
I never thought that something like this can happen.
I have seen such cases on tv, I thought all these years, I had hoped, but I never thought it could be and I like that.
Are emotions.
If I could forgive.
I hope to visit us in the future.
"I hope we can preserve a link" tell us with tears on his cheeks, Crinei mother, while take a napkin tightly.
He hides in tears, happiness, because soon you will see her face after so long bitter weather.
On the other side, Cassel, who will turn over only a few days this month, the 20-year-old trying to stand as well as an emotional child.
I don't know what to expect, but he sketched a vague idea about her biological parents.
Believing that they are young, but now before meeting trying to gather its thoughts, because it has a lot to say, but nothing to complain about.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are ultimately those who have grown up.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a nice recollection with them, because now there are so many things to say," explains Casey.
The first family reunion in Iași
Unirii Square, under the beginning of autumn, joins her family in Ruginoasa again its destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Casey has 20 years ago, finished high school, according to the italian school, but may begin a new chapter with Alina and swallowed her biological parents.
No longer separate borders or countries, but only a barrier of language.
More than that, with the help of a translator, an italian owner of a local in downtown Iaşi, crossed with ease.
Those who managed to make it possible to say that this meeting is the first event of its kind to be done, and that in the future, if it still crops up, will do.
It is the first event of its kind organized by such emotional load, and I'm glad to be a success.
We at the Center, we have different tasks, and most times we associate as being an institution which deals only with people consuming, drug addicts.
But we try to return something back Greenfield.
"If I'm going to be asked for such a evenimeniment, I'll do it dearly," says Iannucci, Director Peter smiling Regional Center of preventive, assessment and Drug Counseling.
Behind him, his family, with Cassel in the Balcan Middle depart recounting.
Are understandable: having many to tell each other.
Truce with weapons, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everyone-and pulls the soul
Camps in branch workers to have concluded an armistice PSD with the gun.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, PSD leaders have agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressured by the party's Executive Chairman, Peter Daou, to present a unified position, the social democrats Romanian nuclear physicists will send him a list of potential candidates from the party functions.
Far from being concluded, the internal war in the party seems to have just took a break to allow combatants to draw the soul.
Dany did not deliver an ultimatum.

Lamb is located but on leave until September 29, preparing elections following virtually assured by the Executive Secretary of the branch, district Councilor Mihail Popescu in the cold relations with Wetherly camp.
Contacted by telephone, Safford has appreciated the discussions of recent days as leading to "a partial consensus '.
There is a wide availability in order to maintain balance and unity in the party.
It has reached a consensus in support of a team uniform meaning that to deal with the County.
"But, on the other hand, there are many variations regarding the intentions of the candidacy related PSD Presidency, the list of remaining open," commented on Safari.

Luke Obrien protects Silviu Baird, who received the highest sentence in this folder.
How motivated the judges sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate of the Police Court of Vaslui which i condemned seven young motivated sentence.
In motivating the judge talks about the reaction to inculpaților, but the brazen and those who have supported, specifying that such an attitude creates a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.

CORBYN, Brexit and the future of Europe
Economic and demographic reasons, prosperity enjoyed in the past dozen years can no longer continue as in subsequent years.
Until Saturday's likely little world he knew in Romania who is Jeremy Corbyn.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the labour party from United Kingdom, many are asking to what extent we can affect the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical stângist of the Labour leadership after the war.
Declared Marxist, anti-monarchist (he had been asked at some point to Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to bring out the Royal family from Buckingam Palace), a ferociously anti-American and a sympathiser of Vladimir Putin (was regularly invited to comment on political events of the television channel "Russia Today"), and the terrorist movements Hamas and Hizbollah, he wants United Kingdom to relinquish nuclear weapons and come out of NATO and the EU.
Reviews for Corbyn, who considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a true tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
After all the demagogues, populiști Corbyn has, of course, miraculous solutions anti-austerity.
The kind of things that they said and promised them and in Greece until Tsipras when he gave his chest with the real world and legitățile.
The economic program of the new Labour leader provides, inter alia, the massive renaționalizări and printing money as the solution for the financing of development projects and coverage of some very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might ask why printing money solution is not universally adopted around the globe, we then have a general world prosperity, but to prevent such details.
Sure, we can charge them to the blood bankers, become a kind of enemies of the left, but from what we have seen so many times in the past, not only in former Communist States in Venezuela or Ecuador times but also in France, at the beginning of his mandates Mitterand and Hollande.
Additional amounts are quickly swallowed by the generous promises without coverage, made by leftist demagogues populiști.
As well it attracted the attention of Margaret Thatcher, "the problem of socialism is that at one point ending money."
Few give real opportunities to reach Jeremy Corbyn ever Prime Minister.
In the early 1980s a radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, which anyway was not as extreme in the belief that the new party leader, failed miserably in the elections.
And then there is yet another class in the United Kingdom, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were noticeably more influential as now.
Under the terms of the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant throughout, and the extensive automation in industries requiring massive labour high qualified, his rhetoric Corbyn has a limited appeal.
However, even from the opposition, he could influence important developments that directly affect us.
In its latest Financial Times believes that the number of Brexit increases the chances of Corbyn, respectively Britain's exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels international capitalism is an agent and promoter of globalization which has imposed austerity to the poor.
When you combine this with the ideas expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that shakes the ground EU reach an explosive mix.
And not just for the United Kingdom.
But if the Brits decided in the aftermath of the referendum, which would take place until 2017, to leave the capital loss symbolic Union of the entire european project and deep fault lines created from inside the Euro crisis and now from that of refugees between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most disturbing scenarios.
Even more so as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the franco-German axis (in which Berlin is becoming more dominant actor).
It's true, British business, City, whether you are strong advocates of the country into the EU.
However, Europe today is no longer that of the past.
There is a lot of resentment, that increase in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we even had a sample in his speech Jean Junker, counsellors could include just tends increasingly to take major decisions over the head of the great majority of the Member States in consultation with just a few powers, mainly Germany.
And this happens in conditions in which the electoral support for antisistem formations, anti-immigration which are at the same time spectacular Eurosceptic increases throughout the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate negative cargo arrived at odds higher than ever in the past.
Hence the conclusion that you draw the Financial Times when assessing Brexit chances.
The pro-EU option relies on a cold calculation that is based on the national interest.
If voters are going to decide, then United Kingdom brain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory we recalled the power of emotion in the present policy.
However, Eastern Europe may be significantly affected by such developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we will witness a more pronounced integration of the Euro area, which will push most of the States of the region and on the outskirts of interest and the process of decision making in Europe.
CORBYN, Tsipras and the Syriza in Greece, even in Spain, Podemos Bernie Sanders in the United States from its populist rhetoric fueling frustrations accumulated in oocidentale societies.
Economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed during the last decades, generous social benefits, can no longer continue as in subsequent years.
Under the pressure of explosive dual crisis of the Euro-zone, both caused by hasty decisions which did not take into account political ambitions than integraționiste, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and Governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, turbulence on the continent, internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can affect the major situation.
And it's hard to miss something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncuși, the peasant.
Rockefeller: ' how can I help you? "
Animation: "Take the broom and the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to arrive, to hear about it.
Behind his renown is hiding but something almost forgotten today, when we are delivered to millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
That something has a name.
Is called "toil".
What to write about Constantin Brâncuși?
What is there to say, really?
His figure appeared on the banknotes.
And, recently, a well known Bank in Romania had hired an actor to play it in a promotional clip.
Brâncuşi produces and delivers money to almost 60 years when it is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and avenues that bears his name.
Moreover, even the author of this text resides on one of these streets.
And when it comes out on out with the offshoot, hears the following instructions: "go into the Park at Brâncuși.
The country is studded his statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose work should be known by the world, from children, to the elderly.
Infiltration capacity of his Animation is one huge.
Neither the Communists failed to get it from memory and culture extirpe.
His quotes dot the Internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of like and share.
And then, again, why would he have to say, writing about this man?
Looked at from stack of books and articles that are trying to reconstruct the life of Brâncuși's destiny seems almost totally improbable fantasy.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you have not had the luck to you naști in any town and in a family as wealthy, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Viaţa lui Brâncuși is non-Abelian.
And perhaps here would be a key.
Perhaps here should start subsequent text.
With one sentence, no matter how loathsome they are.
Forget the stories of successful movie that are delivered daily in newspapers and on television.
Look at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he managed, how, today, he heard a whole world?
It's simple.
He worked throughout his life to be someone.
This has to be done.
Constantin Brâncuși February 19, was born in 1876, a small Certified village in Peștișani commune, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
It is the fifth child of Maria and Sinbo Brâncuși.
Although descended from a family of wealthy peasants, Brâncuși leads a modest life, but one of them have to collect parts which will guide the artistic vision of late.
Remembering your childhood and the places where he grew up, he was going to confess, in a meeting with Petre Țuțea, in Paris in 1933: "back then it was beautiful and harmonious life".
For millennia, people were happy, a longtime, patriarchal.
Everything passed peacefully from one season to another.
And you know why have things changed?
The civilization of the great town has come down to us.
Brâncuși's childhood was far from one.
One of the moments spent in these years receive is highly suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that have characterized the future sculptor in his native town.
The moment is reproduced in the paper "Animation. A biography, written by Darlene Bailey.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuși take 3 years.
In the fall of that year, when the țuica "the cauldron", those who are tasting fluid to see if the process is carried out properly, catch a moment of Brâncuși inadvertently.
Shall fill the scoop with bea Palms țuică and devour.
Falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people notice only after a few minutes.
Mother goes into panic, then hysteria, believing that son i died.
In the evening, when his father, Michael, returns from living together with Fiddler, he sees in the distance signs of the desperate that it waits with baited breath.
Party turns immediately into the gloom.
The father thinks already at îngropăciune.
However, someone found it was a good call, doftoroaie and Baba Brândușa maid to Brâncușilor.
Baby's breath, brânduşa checks then puts under the nose of the horse dung, gathered nearby.
Baby sneezes.
World applauds.
While the boy gets left to sleep further beția, joy, party with well-known continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the orchard.
Radu Constantin Brâncuși puts on to gather some twigs and to bring them to him.
The father shall place the child upside down and, with the stain brought the boy to keep him from beating as mind.
And while he feels the bumps usturimea Brâncuși has the revelation that the world can be seen, and from another perspective, and that things may appear flipped around.
Especially the position of the Sun, different from the well known, causes him to wonder, as you have to recognize at an old age, if not himself attend star has his disorder.
And the Sun has been as troubled as his father of what had happened?
At present, the city is not working
An mp is calling on politicians to remember those who have voted.
Independent Deputy Viorel Blăjuț appealed to PSD and PNL to stop infighting and to divert the agenda toward the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is great and so divisive.
I haven't seen anything in the 2012 draft USL who to continue.
No Highway, no Hospital Regional emergencies, see just how politicians their possible locations according to the real estate interests.
Let's leave aside the politics a little, let us gather and talk.
At present, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with internal warfare, no longer have time for those who get elected," said Blăjuț.

I also said that I do not want to run for the other features.

No money.
