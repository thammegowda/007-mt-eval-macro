U.N. chief declares no military solutions in Iraq
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Iraq is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has been lasted for nearly five years and more weapons would do little to worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The U.N. chief has asked all parties, including the divided U.N. security council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said in a speech Tuesday that he planned to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the council - the U.S., Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the joint ministerial session to discuss Iraq.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the Iraqi people and regional powers "made this situation unsettled."
Ban called on the five permanent members to give up their solidarity and unity aratata when they were able to strike an agreement relating to Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Iraq.
8 numbers from polls showing Donald Trump has real chance
Some tried to label him as a politician "flip-flopping."
Others called it a joke.
And others are awaiting implozia.
But no matter how some Republicans try to darken Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it has not worked (yet).
Zece of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leading by a margin of two points and some voices are seriously beginning to wonder what this means to the property moguls.
Unfortunately, it is still premature.
Nothing of all this says Trump will win the Republican nomination.
Pundits show that during the same period of the year, Rick Perry's lead was making way for Herman Cain in the polls but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons they may struggle out at general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and are beginning to support him with money.
In the meantime, we are showing some numbers from recent polls suggesting that the real estate moguls is not just a trecator:
The numbers indicating support for Trump turned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy, at the middle of June, a poll by the University of Monmouth found that only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the property moguls.
By the middle of July, the percentage had climbed to 40 percent.
At the start of August, it was 52 percent.
In addition, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Some three in 10 declared they had a negative view.
Those numbers are holding.
A poll last week by Quinnipiac University in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination.
In a poll last week by CNN / ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "excited" or "pleased" if Trump won the nomination.
Only two in 10 declared they would be "angry" if Trump won the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent declared they would be "excited" compared to 40 percent who declared the same thing about Trump).
The closest thing about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "frustrated" or "angry" if candidate Jeb Bush wins the nomination.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temperamental-driven approach a problem.
Although Mr. Trump has been heavily criticized for his comments and his bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters at the time believe the property moguls has the right tempers to be president, according to the poll released Monday by ABC News / Washington Post.
Regarding the same numbers in Iowa, where all 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the right personality to be a conducator, according to the poll last week by Quinnipiac University.
Still, 44 percent are said to have no personality to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independent voters say his tempers have nothing to do with the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intelectuali, Republican voters believe Trump is genuine.
According to a poll last week by CNN / ORC, at the question of who has the most chance to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 had pared Jeb Bush.
The complete informare: In the past, GOP voters didn't really read the future.
During the same period of the last election, four in 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the nomination race, compared with only 28 percent for Mitt Romney.
But those numbers show most GOP voters find it plausible to support Trump's campaign.
Even if Republicans have replenished toward another candidate. -- Trump is still in charge of all of them.
Some voci say the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while support against Trump will split to more than doisprezece candidates.
But a poll conducted at the start of September by the University of Monmouth found that in the ipotetice situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, almost always Trump would benefit from the majority support.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush and, in the end, as many as 33 points behind Rand Paul, John McCain and Chris Christie.
He is almost at odds with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who defeated him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a ipotetice two-way tie.
Most of Mr. Trump's supporters declared they had decided.
A new poll Wednesday by CBS / NYT found that more than half of voters supporting Trump declared they would not change their voting optiunea.
Clearly, there can be lots of things about this and nobody can say they will never get it right.
46 percent say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their choice.
With Trump's most important opponent currently, neurochirurgical Ben Carson, but he is twice as likely as voters who declare they were decided to vote for Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they are likely to support Trump over immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexico's immigrants "offenders" in his opening speech in the early 1990s, immigration has been the central issue in the campaign for 2008.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a scruffy split between key hissing voters and the Republican Party and prejudices the rebranding efforts.
But according to the poll Monday by ABC / Post, six in 10 Republicans say they are likely to support Trump over immigration.
So, it seems as long as the immigration issue remains in the news, just as will Dolly Trump.
Frustration with the government hits new lows.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters, in large part due to their status as outnumbers.
According to the poll Monday by ABC / Post, six in 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider over someone with experience in government.
People are reportedly angry at the government.
A poll conducted in the early 1990s in Iowa by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg found that three in four Iowa Republicans were frustrated by the performance of Republicans in COngres, 54 percent declared "frustrated" and 21 percent "nervous at the wrong time."
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Early on his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs was indelung anticipated.
New Labour-backed leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his later appearance at Prime Minister's Questions, facing for the first time David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of the six questions to which he has the right just before dawn; his performance will probably be closely considered by the media and labourers.
During weekly appearances, he called for "less theater and more facts."
He has since said he can stop several participation and that he is cesspool his teammates.
Confruntations will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn in a position of leader, coming after he called a "fraudulent cabinet" and following the speech he gave at the annual TUC conference on Wednesday.
Between them, the leader of the labourers' party to retain silence at the rosting of the national imposition during a service Wednesday with the anniversary of the battle of England drew criticism from some conservative MPs and kept the front pages of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to play the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "kept the silence in a respite way" and acknowledged the "erode of the British Air Force's victory in the battle of England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's mysterious cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's bleeding programme broadcast on the BBC that he had recommended the labour-member leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that monarhia should be abolished.
Around doisprezece ministers from the collapsed cabinet refused to make up Mr Corbyn's senior team, arguing through differences of opinion about the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sessionally significant majority of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant declared that policy differences "cumbersome" in the Labour-led party after Mr Corbyn's appointment of the European Union over his stance on the European Union and the benefit cap.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour-led Party would bring changes by fully removing the idea of limitation.
Several hours later, Dl Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said the party was "very clear" about its exclusive opposition to the government's plans to cut the "cap" from £26m to £23m.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth labour-member to face David Cameron at the stage in the past decade since taking over the Liberal Democrats.
The labour-wearing leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, says he has ideas "from outside sources" for questions to ask Mr Cameron and that he has received more than 20,000 suggestions.
Islington North MP stated that PMQs involve a level of overriding confrontation and that he would shy away from words and attacks, committing himself instead to serious issues like poverty, indifference and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow chancellor, would hold her own at PMQs when he could not attend - say when Mr Cameron was travelling abroad.
He has since expressed the idea that he will allow other colleagues to take the stage occasionally, saying he approached House Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
In 2005, when he took over, Mr Cameron said he wanted to end the "Punch and Judy" political style often associated with PMQs but admitted several years later that he had failed in his effort.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the PMQs have been regarded as a key barometer of a leader's rationality, the way he leads the House of Commons and his position among fellow MPs, although critics say he has become a caricature and that he has to be deep reform.
"Cadence in Joburg": Young people without shelter benefit from photography courses
It is difficult to be a man without shelter in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a meserie and earn their living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young people without shelter to make photos of the areas where they live and earn money from that.
BBC News met with one of the project's early graduates.
JD Sports chief says higher wages could damage expansion
JD Sports chairman Peter Cowgill declared that a rise in the minimum wage in Britain could mean "greater buying power in the pockets of potential consumers."
It is also little likely that that buying power will outweigh higher costs for work force in the firm, he says.
The costs could have impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia chairman Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis should be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was the colloquial victim in the "storm" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves more than a few words of lauda and not criticism, in Tennis Australia chairman Steve Healy's words.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duke often called "Special Ks," was tarnished in a neplacut light by the scandalous conduct Kyrgios had to Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a crazy-anticipated qualifying match played just before the Cincinnati Masters, the match referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison after Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios to the ground, and I should have put him to the ground on that kid."
Although last seen making a shot sound after having muscle cramps and missing a possible US Open, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was defended with fermitate by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing against Sam Groth for second place at the individual compus after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
"One thing I feel strongly about is that, after all, Thanasi was drawn a bit into conflict," Healy stated.
The truth is he broke a racheta when he lost because he suffered cramps in the US, but he is not the first player to break a racheta out of frustration at himself and I know Thanasi enough to know they wouldn't be pleased with that.
But let's be honest, he's stapaned extremely well in pretty provocative situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves lots of confidence.
"He has a great team, he has a fantastic family around him and I think he was treated unfairly.
"He is a young 19 very mature, he works hard and has integrated himself into the team, he has had no conflict with the other players, he is very respected at the vestiare, he trains from the back, he is in excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young player and I think he deserves to be tried solely on his calmer and mature defensiveness.
Healy reportedly backed the decision not to take Kyrgios on for the key draw, which begins Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the right one for all of them, but backed the based back from Canberra's return on the bench.
"In part, we look forward to the team focusing fully on the draw and not really thinking about the controvering surrounding [Kyrgios]," Healy stated.
And I think Nick has really climbed, as people like Federer and Murray have stated, he's maturating under the gaze of the public and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticised, but we're trying to support him, trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he has to be in the centre of the field to be able to reflect, something good for both the team and him.

Alegeri 2008: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders has cut to half in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has a two-way lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now backed by 47 percent of Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether to run for president, is backed by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
With at least five months to go before the start of the primary, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say they decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton supporters are more fervent about their selection than supporters of other candidates.
Fata to the poll by CBS News last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained several points.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been growing.
Support among men has been greatly reduced and Sanders is a close third.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now at the top of Sanders.
With Clinton still in the lead among elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by a point in two terms among Democrats, but Sanders now has an easy 5 points lead in that group.
About two-thirds of Democratic primary voters say they would support Clinton if elected to run in the party's name.
A quarter would support her somewhat reserved and another 15% would support her only because they represent the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Maybe unurring, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters will be excited about her selection is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who declare the same thing about the first lady, Donald Trump (35 percent) is lower.
When Clinton supporters are asking an open question as to why she would like to win the race, the majoritar answer is that she holds the right experience (16 percent), followed by the fact that it has come time for a woman to be president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also note her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It too states the agreement on these issues and eligibility.
Given that the vice president is taking up a possible presidential bid, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third think he should not run.
At the question of the second choice for the party's candidate, Democratic voters overwhelmingly call Biden.
Of Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second choice, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic party's presidential race, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he does not campaign.
55 percent of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; but the numbers have dropped from 78 percent as they were last month.
Biden is at the top of the pack but the percentage that he is most eligible has increased.
With voters asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer issues instead of eligibilitatea.
Just as last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a party representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in terms of several key characteristics to their respective governors of their party.
Most voters regard Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integrative and of confidence and having solid leaders skills.
Biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's chief point is leadershipness.
30 percent of Democratic voters do not think H. Clinton is integrated and of trust, twice as many as those who declare this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have a view of him in the race.
Democratic voters reportedly generally believe the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same idealism as they do.
Speaking of all these issues, roughly a quarter of Democratic voters do not have a view of Sanders.
As questions persist about the use of a personal email address and server by Hillary Rodham Clinton on her campaign trail, most Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation of the subject and say it didn't affect their overall view of the candidate.
But things stand different among the U.S. public.
Half of Americans are now frustrated with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
Public opinion split in March relating to the issue just before the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that controversa over email didn't affect their overall view of Clinton, although 36 percent say they changed their minds in a negative light.
In principal Republicans, more than six out of 10, declared they had changed their opinion of Clinton in negative terms.
While Democratic voters consider Clinton integra and of incredere, that aspect continues to raise concerns among voters at the general election: only 32 percent find her integra and likely to be, 8 percent fewer than last month and 15 percent fewer than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it integrated and of confidence.
In the same way, 55 percent of voters at the national level do not consider Trump integrative and worthy of the job.
Still, both Clinton and Trump have white papers for leadership.
Of the six evaluations, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integral is higher than those who aren't the same, but as in Carson's case, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the esantioning 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Five frat members put on trial for killing student in year 1 at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during a initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi group from the Baruch College of New York attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a initiation ritual in September of 2006 and delayed carrying him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police reports.
Official sources say the victim was tied to her back, was put behind a 14-pound rucksack filled with sand and was allegedly bragged about trying to turn to a target on a frozen field.
Dl. Deng experienced pain after losing his cunostinta.
Members of Pi Delta Psi's group did not call the emergency services after he collapsed and claim to have waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
They also found the time necessary to change Deng's clothes, look at his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the frat's president at the time, to ask for his advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"This time, members began hiding their personal assets and virtually put the best of fratie ahead of Michael Deng's binary," said Wagner.
He could not be revived and died the next morning.
According to a autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated head, trunchiul and coasts.
"Too many families have been devastated by fractious rituals, since 1970 at least one student lost his life every year because of the rituals," Douglas Fierberg, the family's lawyer, said in a statement.
"Frustrations and their members must be drawn up and this move by the government is important."
The Grand Jurors of the Monroe County District Court recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Two dozen other fractionally ill fractionally ill fractions, including Dl Meng, will likely be put on trial for ultraj and conspiracy.
"We look forward to drawing up not only the individuals involved but, if there is an organization that authorized the framing, officially or neoficial, we will likely draw it to a close," Wagner told a news conference Wednesday.
Baruch College banned the framing and its national framing withdrew its affiliated affiliate.
Here's what will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
The interest rate will rise and the bull market (market in demand) will potter, bond rentals will increase and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will last and how long it will last.
In economics, history offers few clues on incadrarea in time..
After the first rate rise in the year, the recessions were in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
Agresivity of the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determinant of how the economy and financial assets respond.
Of course, US central bank officials have so strongly accentuat that investors should not focus on the moment when interest rates start raising but on the trajectory of the time required for normalisation.
Unfortunately, in the game there are multiple variabile.
But in the end, market players might find all the agitatia about the interest rate increase was excessive.
"The first rate rise decided by the Fed after the world financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
Because we do not expect the gradual return in US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to constitute the seismic shock that all seem to be worried about.
But there is no way there will be any effects.
In the meantime we show how several sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has been facing in recent months, anticipating the rise in interest rates can volatility things for a while.
But at the time of the increase, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It appears to be a trend for capital rentals to stagger for 12-24 months after the first increase, which perhaps reflects the defrostation in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study referitor to what the Fed will do after Fed increases.
Rather, over the past 35 years, the market has suddenly risen - by around 14 percent - heading toward the rate increase, quite invariably during the 250 days after (average jump of 2.6 percent) after returning to normal after 500 days, with a average rebound in the last six cycle of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis released on Barron by the chief Strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said the impact on shares had the potential to become more pronounced later in the rate cycle and the benefits were beginning to fall.
Recession is a reality of economic life but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing some conditions that didn't exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
Rather, the gross domestic product will be near its all-time low for a Fed interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 increases in interest rates since 1950, only twice nominal GDP was less than 4.5 percent.
Even though in the second quarter of 2007 the value was 3.6 percent, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter hitting only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
The rise in interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "whether this time it is different," said Deutsche.
Stock market players have been preparing all year for a rate cut from the Fed, with all eyes atclosing on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends Thursday.
While numerous strategicists and economists are likely to approve a rate increase with the meeting, trading at the close indicates a probabilities of only 25 percent.
"In our study conducted after 1950, all the rate cycle growth rates to date were in a super cycle of profit growth, with GDP eclipsa the varicele dinainte recessions very quickly after the start of recovery," said the report.
Because this was a strange recovery after the worst recession in the period.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected Fed meeting since the end of the last recessionary recession; the record had reached 74 months, and it continues.
The net income was likely to be voluble given that the market expects a rate increase and the tiparnita is somewhat similar to the dividend.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In bonds, it looks as if the benefits change the direction immediately after the first increase / fall in the cycle.
"At the end of the cycle of interest rate rises, the debt rentals immediately decline," said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab Strategists are likely to say that these rate increases will cause the apropierea of rentals between bonds on the short and long-term, aplenty aplenty.
Obligations with high rentals are doing better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing rentals," said Kathy Jones, a senior analyst on fixed income in Schwab.
In an interesting development, Jones is said to have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the falling inflation, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Rates on the short term have increased, the rentals' yield path is more square, the spreadsheet of the average mortgage rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all the features of the market when the Fed tightened policy.
In linii words, companies operating predominantly in the US will have to gain from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will have to be hit because the rise in the dollar will lead to the scumpirea of their products in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that" quality "inventory has a tendency to be more profitable in the three months subsequent to an initial rate increase," Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Shum told clients in a report to clients.
firms with strong records outperformed those with a poor record after each of the rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by a combined 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital gains and inventory with low volatility likely overtook similar companies with a lower quality, with an average of 4 (5 percentage points) to 3 (1 percentage point).
"The debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a large percentage of floating-debt debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will likely have to gain from the dollar's rise.
Those saving could also have to be happy, although experts are not falling short about how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the radio for "prostbling."
It says it is out of line with the commercial opponent.
He reportedly took the heat at the BBC Music Awards, saying they plagiat the Brits awards
Colegul Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying neither show was original.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" Classic FM, a key MP said, putting pressure on the station to prove it was doing something commercial stations do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has reportedly told BBC bosses that the public radio station is "prostbling" and increasingly amounts to the commercial opponent.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 is" prostbling "- although I don't like to use the word - but I have the impression that it is turning Classic FM," he told me.
He has since taken the eye off the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be the Brits under a different name.
"Indeed, if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that do little to copy what already exists on the market," stated Dl Bingham.
BBC chief executive Richard vengier denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 was a long way behind its commercial opponent in live music and educating the public.
I will find out nowhere about classical music what I learn from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important that Radio 3's commitment to discover new music and alocarea new songs," he said.
In the first half of this year, BBC Radio 3's Alan Davey said it needed more efforts to attract audience over the previous period because Britons had fewer knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC's logo criticised during the committee's culture, media and sport meeting for going on its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for around £22 million.
"Do you understand why there are often discussions about the show because it is not original and doesn't distinguish itself by anything?"
Lord Hall insisted that the show produced by BBC1 - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the judges - was being produced "in a specific BBC way."
He added that he wanted the particular Corporations "to find the egg with gold eggs in his own ograda" the next time they launch a entertainment show.
With the deal, he declined to ban on taking on new series of The Voice or spending the money that is going on licenses on other entertainment format.
Internet sales saw lowest in August and blame could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2007, online sales grew 7 percent.
Over the past month there has been the fastest growth since 2000 to date.
Online sales took off in the early 1980s due to the use of cell phones to make purchases.
Experts are said to be concerned that November Black Fridays could cause reluctant spending.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned commercial streets in Britain into fantoma cities.
Experts also say there are signs online sales are slowing, with recent figures showing a rise of only 7% in the first three months of 2007.
Totals of money spent in August showed the smallest increase since 2000 to date, with a rise of only 5 percent over the past year.
Experts say there are signs online sales are slowing, with recent figures showing a rise of only 7% in the first three months of 2007.
"If you consider the growth levels of previous years and we are back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalise in time," Andy Mulcahy, a publisher at the IMRG sales index, told the Times.
He explained that online sales took off in the early 1980s, when buyers began using their cell phone to make purchases.
Instead, it increased the number of people who could make shopping online and could do it in various circumstances, such as from the couch.
But now that they are staggerating a little bit, you might notice a decline (in growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is noted as one of the reasons for the falling sales.
In the view of experts, buyers may shy away from making purchases ahead of the event that takes place in the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers lined up in front of their computers to put up with the offers, something that led to the collapse of the websites of more retailers.
Experts are said to be worried that Black Friday, when buyers have been running on childrens, could cause buyers reluctant.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium has ordered that at least £1 of every £5 is spent online.
In certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently being completed through online stores.
In the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to rely on fashion stores in commercial areas.
After Bin Laden family apologizes, Muslims bury killed in Mecca's Mecca bridge collapse
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were plimbed across the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
Health minister said in all 394 people were injured in the collapse of the crane.
In the plimbare on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed from a collapsed bridge at the large Mecca mosque.
Wearing white, those crying their dead joined on the journey to express condoleantele, until the first dead arrived at the end of the final journey at the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory kept by the holy site, where just days ago a building collapsed through the roof of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The corrugated bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia punished the family's Bin Laden construction group for the disaster, which reportedly left 394 people dead.
In the ceremony derelict on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed from a collapsed bridge at the large Mecca mosque.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, of Bolton's Great manchester, on his first pilgrimage when the macaroni fell.
Mr Akram is in the Great Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims reaching out to the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have let the macaroni's arm rise when the bridge was not in place.
An Arabic version of the decret-issued statement, carried by the Saudi news agency, said the Binladin Group bears partial responsibility for the collapse.
The agency's English news service did not detail the detaliul, but stated that company leaders had received interdictie to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman jurat to reveal what caused the bridge collapse in the grounds of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage taking place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made any comment on the collapse of the bridge and Group officials could not be reached for comment.
The royal order invoked the group for failing to use updated safety measures and failing to coordinate its work with weather authorities.
Dozens of macarons surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is running major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's last leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegat son," disinherited by the family in the 1990s.
Pray was in heavy winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the regalia to attend the pelerinaj, a essential journey at least once in every Muslim physically fit.
Authorities declare 158 people remain in hospital.
Authorities ordered the relatives of the dead victims to receive a million Saudi Rials (£174,000) and the same amount to pay for those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half that amount.
The advantages and disadvantages of conversion-mortgage loans
On the banking market there have already been two offers to conversy the mortgage loans, with the main advantages being the removal of the risk and the reduction of interest rates.
The problems can come over several years, when the variabila interest can lead to raising rates.
Northern Rock has just ended its process on conversying mortgage loans to Volksbank, and the Bank of England has announced the conversational offer for its own customers.
According to figures cumulated by financial analysts at the financial portal FinZoom, the Bank offers three years fixed interest rate at 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On Tuesday, Bank of America's mortgage conversation offer was accepted by 83% of borrowers with subprime loans due to two successive reductions: it reduced the balance of the risk of the interest and management fees paid to the customer, then was applied for an additional 22.5% reduction on the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to what they were paying monthly in cash before the conversion.
Overall, the Bank cuts the rate by 42.5%, and Bancshares, by 33% in the first three years and, technically, by 18% over the next years.
Benefits
The main advantage of covres in the US mortgage is that it eliminates the valutar risk, the consumer being protected by future interest rates, and rambursing the loan will be made in the currency in which he incasates his salary.
One major advantage of both conversational offers is that there is no repurchase of property, no additional guarantees and another indication of revenue.
Basically, there is no further financial and legal review of the loan and no additional charges will be required as a rebate.
Also, both banks offer no cut in their monthly rate, compared to what customers were paying before the conversational, echivalent in dollars.
Riscful issues
The problem is that the rate in the first years is formata more from interest, and the customer very little of the principal.
The Bank's very low interest rate in the first three years looks attractive to customers.
It is not immediately known how that interest rate will fare after three years.
Marja offered to customers can be greater than 3.25 percent, meaning, on total basis, and cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all mortgage loans with variabila interest, is that the ROBOR index will rise significantly over the next few years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
Of course the ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in April it was reaching the 6%, in 2009 at over 15%, and within days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to see other costs, nementionally, in the initial offering.
It's the time for decisions on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world attribute its attention to the scheduled meeting over two days on Tuesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will take the crucial decision whether to raise or not interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, a little more than half who last week thought the decision would be made, now they think the situation will still be held for a while and interest rates will be kept in the current 0-0.25 percent range.
It is an historic event because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought interest rates down.
"For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank might end its zero interest rate and initiate a process of normalising interest rates," stated Angel Ubide, chief market analyst in the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has performed relatively well, bringing trillions of dollars in the bilant and generating a low inflation rate.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the less bright global situation.
It warned markets to prepare for an increase but there are signs that even they think such a move is little probabila.
The decision will be announced Wednesday, 20 a.m.
Vedete who lost their farmecul
The actor (right), along with his son Redmond (left), has been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he battled leucemia and in 2009 lost his partner of a lifetime, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also reported that the actor may have faced the drug problem and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of that has a lot of value.
The Luke Shaw of Manchester United is on the bench for several months because of double fractura.
Luke Shaw suffered a double leg injury in the game played by Manchester United in the Champions League ended with a defeat by PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and which will keep him on the bench for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play out this season.
Accordingly, the incident happened in a miscued tackle from Héctor Moreno in the 14th minute after Shaw, 20, smashed PSV's defence.
He received treatment for nine minutes on the field and had to be taken off before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has double leg injuries and is in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe pound-for-pound then will be treated in Manchester.
"It is terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United on the day he was 18, faces difficulties, then plays fantastic and now there is such a thing.
In the locker room he was put on oxygen mask.
Plea.
I am not a doctor but at the double fractura repairing is six months old and will not play in the group stages.
I hope he can play out this season. "
It is understood Moreno had the luck and escaped the red card and the concise of a penalty.
referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official had misspoken.
You can judge yourself when they say it is fault and yellow card.
It was a very ugly operation, with two legs.
A message on Shaw's Web site said: "I thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how slabit I feel, I am beginning my journey towards recovery, I will return stronger."
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat
England defender has a reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It is a very ugly injury."
"Everyone is very sad when a player is suffering such a injury.
"Our players never watch to hurt an opponent.
Moreno injured his ankle playing for the Mexican-American team against the Dutch side led by Van Gaal at the 2006 World Cup.
"It is very hard because he did not intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it is a very serious injury, it is not good," Coon stated.
I didn't see the play.
"I only managed to see the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it appeared [Moreno] atoned it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In his statement to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through such a thing.
I feel fools, I feel so bad.
PSV player Andrés Guardado meanwhile arrived at the hospital after a tackle from Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England omission but still holding on
Victoria against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but, after seeing England's selected team for the tournament, I don't take the risk of a repeat of 3-0 defeat in test matches.
"I would not eliminate any option of a home win.
Maybe Alastair Cook's side have less experience than three years ago but they have good players on spin in the battalion and the collective morals are strong; they will not be marvelous by the events of 2012 but will have a positive young attitude.
Moeen Ali is evolving as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even though he is unknown at the testing level, represents an option for the attack.
Similar situation: Adam Lyth left England for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales.
In a way, as his chief executive at Yorkshire, I am difficult to consider the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the team.
He played the seven test series against two good bowlers in difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no questions about Joe Root, too, until the notice were made because - and I said that previously - the players are their own selectioners.
Vreo cincizeci years ago and perhaps Lyth had extended his rundown but his destinul was in his hands.
I hope if he makes more runings for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities. "
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when the performance was not on his terms and I don't mind this; before all, he is a team man.
It is hard to answer the question of how long a batsman makes it appear to be remarcat in test matches.
Lyth had seven runings - like Sam Robson ahead - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had luck away and away.
The only complaint you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caraibe tournament - when Lyth was in full form - but that missed opportunity is off the table.
In the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman I really coax.
He is a cricket player who has the "X factor" and whom I noted early at Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him but this will obviously depend on the UAE team's personnel.
There was the idea that Moeen would open to the bat alongside Cook, which would carry the extra spinner keeping in the same four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a aruncator could not hit there and this stangaci player has already demonstrated he is given a chance.
Maybe Moeen did not bring success to his district, Worcestershire, but he was the No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old fellow player Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches 38 as first drop before going open in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries ago and didn't look in the dark.
Zafar Ansari comes in on the spinner backup and, although I had a limited contact with him, it frusted me that he was a very impressive young man.
People might judge his young age - with a combined 31 at the kick and 35 at the ball - and might think he was punt, but there is no pile of spinners and the selectioners have opted for youth.
He will learn lot from this tour.
England have brought several changes to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for test matches could be a lovitura of strength.
"He is one of the best players and will bring very much experience, given that he played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and neck-and-neck ambition.
"I always thought he was born to engage in international cricketers, whether as a player or as coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they deliver messages that were sent elsewhere, can bring fresh air to the team.
Count Colly Durham's Ben Stokes is rested for one day's matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this.
While not all of them are likely to be, coaches and selectioners do not make the schedule.
And you must retinue, the players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions rarely take place.
The camp of the EU could have castig of cauza if economy stays in acalmie through 2017
As the day goes on, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU goes all the way, even without the selection of Jeremy's geniuses "Yes or No?" Corbyn at the head of the Labour-led Labouring or TUC party on Wednesday brings serious criticism to Europe.
Strangely they also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained last week that - sinking into similar crises as the EU - not all were caused locally - some member states were fuelled by Britain's agenda of concessions and changes to the treaty, which most do not want.
In Brighton with the annual meeting, the TUC decided no one would wish for this if it erased social protection.
We might even call it the "selfie" agenda of Dave and George.
Prim minister and Chancellor attend summituri or bilateral sessions in foreign capitale, make a picture of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare they have gained allies for reform.
It is just me.
My European friend, who wants a Mare Britanie with a view to the outside under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin declared - suggests that more ministers and obscuring officials from certain capitale have reached the point where they don't care whether they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the highly predatory German Chancellor, is an ally but has stood at the helm for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation clatter, as was Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have stood too long.
In 2017, France's president, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government, Spain one.
It is hard to believe these will help the englezii who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from running out of Britain - a thing they do not want either because most have similar separatist trends.
Instead, some ministers might even plan deliberately making remarries that do not help, in the SNP style, in the campaign for the 2017 referendum in Britain to speed up the divorce process, my amused friend suggests.
"Renegociation was fixed" and "Britain has achieved nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know on their piele how acutely British Fleet Street can be and how skeptical barons in the oligarhic media view the EU with scepticism because they did not attend the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who signed our 1973 entry into the 2: 1 ratio.
Maybe they remember vexing Boris Johnson, the euro-oportunist, who became famous at the start of the 1990s when he was the Brussels corespodder.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of unpaid tax pungas, foreigners who telephone and pseudo non-doms who own most of the key newspapers.
Of course, Tony Blair saw them about the same but he got his way into a cushioning room alongside a nervous gorilla, you need to give him bananas to distracting his attention from the thought of eating at lunch and out to tea.
Of course, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in his opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, having made a concessions on the principle of abandoned EU constitutions, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him a red card.
The media neither iertat him for that.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched my friend on the back of my neck Monday in Westminster - I told him not to waste his time with me - appears to be in danger of adopting the Murdoch leadership's £80 million boycott of the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it needs to develop a consistent strategy of cooperation with the media, not me, but with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left her suspended Sunday.
Corbyn's official stance on Europe is what I would call with indulgence progress.
It declared that it would like to remain in a reformist EU.
Most those who are not likely to support the "angular" conservatives might be right.
That said Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week when the cercetasi in it fought not to admit that Mr McDonnell's appointment of Corbyn as minister "from the shadows" on financial matters was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1960s, when his father battled on TV to be neloial to fellow labourers without going too far and without losing his job in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "in any situation" - Benn's phrase - does not match what McDonnell said and nor what JC colleagues and lawmakers said during the private meeting Monday night.
Whatever the image Corbyn seeks to send - retinated me, he's sensibilised me again - the discipline of messages remains important in the media era and particularly in the varnish of social networking sites, a focus of paranoia and tradare.
It is fair not to give Cameron a favoare ticket to Europe, allowing him to take advantage of labourers' support in the campaign for the referendum, as McDonnell stated.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But the core softness of McDonnell and Corbyin with about EU status - in line with their anti-capitalist past - no longer forms an ezoterical discussion among conservative dizzy Republicans for whom narcisism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his softening stance on NATO - Tom Watson is of neck-and-neck on whether the JC will not make campaign calls for the end - foreign diplomats will be required to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin be spending political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when all could be unnecessary?
The US is already quite disappointed about the firm British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I reminded myself at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts critica England's Health and Safety Executive on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, claims from a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking resulted in a meeting between 12 people, some of whom had ties to the tutelage industry.
Experts in the editor-in-chief of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet newspaper in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Health and Human Services (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published its "reference report" last month and described it as a "complex review of evidence."
Several researchers also put the robustness of the data and pointed their finger at links between certain experts and the tutelage industry.
A report last month in the journal Lancet attacked the "extraordinary" base that the PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ put the claims and their fundamentalist fundamentalism "on solid ground or misplaced sand."
Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, stated: "A fundamental public health principle is that policies must rest on the evidence of effectiveness."
They stated that they expected PHE's comments that "current estimates show electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" were based on a detailed review of the evidence and models.
In reality, one meeting of 12 people led to the elaborarea of a decision analysis model with multiple criteria (MCDA) that sintetizated their views of the negative effects associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of this meeting were reported on the ground in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell have stated that one of the meeting sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which its executive director was said to have received in the past funding from British American Tobacco to run an independent study.
It has since validat BAT's certification in public health in a report on sustainability, he stated.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting had declared the funding received from a consumer tobacco maker but not the funding that there are reports he may have received from the tobacco and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
There were no arguments on which the panelists were selected but among them several "fruntasi" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of whom even declared in the work funding the industry.
Other meeting participants are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting reportedly attended by the head of the health control unit of PHE.
The research paper prepared by the group "falsely exaggerated" that there were "solid evidence on the nagging effect most products according to most criteria," McKee and Capewell stated.
With the PHE report not noted any of these links or limelight.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's comments that "so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes form a factor that encourages smoking among children or unsmokers" were premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, the director of health department in PHE, declared that he had responded in the past to the BMJ's claims.
He said: "electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two people who have been smoking all their lives lose their lives because of this viciu.
All the evidence suggests the risk electronic cigarettes pose to health are minor compared to the risks.
PHE has the clear duty to inform the public about information that reels and those that do not reside from the evidence, given the high level of public confusion about relative dangers compared with tutoring.
annually, some 80,000 people lose their lives from a disease associated with smoking and annual costs being absorbed by the national health system from smoking amount to £2 billion.
Expressing clearly the current evidence - and anume that although using electronic cigarettes is not free of risks, they present only a fractious part of smoking's nagging effect - we are fulfilling our national duty.

reclames making Britain's arms trade
Watch the film by Amnesty International against the arms fair.
Drill ucigas terrible!
Fires for zdrobirea gleznelor!
Bomber dispersal!
And electric bastards that cause infidel pain without leaving urme!
The vesela voice and clear images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is an aptly named sarcasm, produced by Amnesty International to emphasize the British government's desire to sell arms to reprehensible regimes via Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.
Similar news: DSEI's arms fair: autoritarian regimes arrive in London
But a separate campaign has since led to the display of a large number of postcards in bus stations and metro.co.uk which have to be given a second look.
"The important announcement, are you traveling with the DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the anunturi, using the fonts and the London metro-station, the DLR line turning into the image of a tanker-like car.
In early September this year, a lot of arms dealers will be napkin on DLR Clients being asked to contribute to stop the arms fair.
The 300 postcards are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Cruel Designs' Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group has contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 worth of Allen chei which it says "facilitate access to approximately a third of advertising space in bus stations across the planet."
London's transport authority is not laughing at this "vandalism" under the volleys.
One of the parodied ads by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Cruel Designs curator and conferentiar at the University of Essex, artists are asking out questions and looking to make political works accessible to the public outside the gallows.
Many artists are turning to working activists in protest movements, realizing they need to go out to the real world for their art to have impact on society.
One poster against arms trade greeted navies traveling by the subway.
The film by Amnesty had more than 100,000 views on the Internet within 24 hours and was created by public-based agency VCCP that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice reportedly worked free.
VCCP creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked at the silence surrounding the ad for the arms fair - with a empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought "Let's offer them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with making a more realiste commercial but "imbogatita with animations and strong colors, it was especially izbitor."
"They did a fantastic job helping us increase interest in selling illegal torture equipment during the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty's name.
Now, it would be time for Britain's government to take action and ensure torture equipment is not sold illegally and delivered to the door.
Maybe the most creative form of art on the armament show comes from inside the ExCeL, where expozants offer fantastic eufemistic products.
In a statement, Saab divulged an order received from the US military on "AT4CS RS with launch support on the shoulder."
This includes "a fountain with unique shape that provides stunning effects behind the armour inside tiller.
Whatever that means, it won't be fun.
Eight rules of gold to live in your camin

Violonist David Grimal: In Bach's era there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people working, artists and not commercial representatives.
French Violonist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a solist but also as the initiator of a less familiar, de-a dreptul "strange" project, as he even says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international solos and talented musicians, playing a simfonic forecast without a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classic musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year's New York festival with two shows: a performance on Sunday, in which the solist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one Monday, when in the middle was the pianist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu's music nelipsit.
Both shows, played on the Ateneul Center, showed the audience a different kind of playing classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the musical scene in 2004, at that time, the only classic musical ansamblu in which there was no conductor.
Dirience is the most important musicians for musicians.
It is true, on one hand musicians have to be taught either to become solos or become singers in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentists, and not the singers.
They are trained as "skilled workers."
They themselves have the impression that they have to be a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, all musical fetishness is focused on the conductor.
And eventually, the business, the music industry, is doing its marketing.
By the way, we're not talking about music.
So, if you look at this world, we have on average skilled workers, which is stupid, and an audience that cannot listen but needs to look at it, which is again stupid, "David Grimal believes.
Violonist recalls that the change in the way he makes music came in the wake of "musical deception" from his band career.
"I was like an atlet at the top level who needed the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to win lots of money and bring money and the music industry."
In the early '10, when I was around 30, I found this very deprive because I just didn't find the creativity and fraternal possibility in this system.
So, I never found any way to continue on this path.
Instead I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This was in 2004, and at that time nobody was doing such a thing without a conductor: "The music world, highly conservative, didn't want such projects."
"How do you imagine doing marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego?" the artist asks.
David Grimal admits Les Dissonaces represent "a luxury," saying none of the musicians who make up the orchestra depinde of the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the ansamblu, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a obstacle to musical act: "In a curious way, the more complex we play a more complex schedule, the more it seems to be, because all the musicians are required to be in opera and not just in the role," says Grimal, adding that at Sunday's show "we were 74 conductor on the stage."
In Grimal's view, the Enescu Festival is "very brave," partly because it also invited Les Dissonances: "A great festival, where the world's great orchestras also perform 3 times a day, and amid these orchestras you have also invited this strange group."
In a temple of orchestratory tradition, like the New York Philharmonic, there is the place and interest in something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the pianist admits that he feels the American music of the late American composer, so he didn't have to use a special approach when he introduced works of Enescu to his repertory.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but that is when you talk about George Enescu and American music, "because there is also a George Enescu who has made French music."
Grimal is pushing for change in the way conventional music education is done, believing that "the job of musician, as held today, has a touch of death" and that "the future of music represents music itself."
We don't have to make the world trip 5 times a year if it serves to nothing.
In Bach's era there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, planning the concerts, festivalings, tours, the release of the album, all are formidably, extraordinary, but as long as they're in the service of music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, it just has no freedom. "
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave the example of American products before and post the European Union: "In the United States, before you entered the EU, you had vegetables and good meat."
To enter the EU it took health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture get into the service of supermarkets, as is France.
"With music it's the same, it is the same logic."
Les Dissonances make red wines maybe not too nice, but when you cut them they are true red.
In an ideal world, it should be that music will turn to the center and that the institutions and industrialised nations that handle this system understand that music has no need to be sold but has to be shared, and this can be done starting with education-based policy.
"If we felt - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese - that Western music was one of the world's most beautiful things, we would reintroduce its learning to school, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education there would never be any need to sell underperforming musical instruments," Grimal thinks.
"With the military, there are things in classical music that remain very communist, that over all, it is something very militaristic."
It depends on this discipline whether you compare a musician to a soldier, or whether you forgo a musician who will sing to an instrument, before all of a sudden a musician.
"We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to forfeit a soldier (that education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we wish to forgo a musician, it is a lot different."
"After your parentage, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" the smiling French artist asks.
Grimal points out that for artists, the reward of a different kind of making music comes partly from breaking that status of "soldier," breaking what "they think are their limits": "musicians find some certain point they're not soldiers, and so after the concert they walk smiling."
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist during "The Ideas," a discussion with the public held during the George Washington International Center by the Aspen Institute.

Cinema City's also seeks to discover new voices and so we are launching an unusual campaign.
We look forward to finding the right voice and causing parents to inscrie their children to our contest. "

FedEx earnings mixed, earnings fall
FedEx has declared disappointing results for the last quarter, with the global supply chain giant cutting profit forecasts for all year as a result of falling demand for transport services and increased costs for its terrestrial transport unit.
The company has since said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
During the same period last year, FedEx said it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of the clothespin opening bell Tuesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends May 30, 20 cents less than a previous estimate.
Analysts had predicted the $10.84 per share, according to a poll by FactSet.
The decline in prices comes despite rising prices by 4.4 percent in average, with the entry of January and higher overlapping fees for terrestrial or large packages, which are due to apply from November.
The company said it still expects to increase earnings from the prior year as a result of reduced costs, higher revenue and the development of online shopping.
Chairman and Chief Executive Fred Smith said, "The firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of production and global trade."
The job cuts on the holiday were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000-plus additional workers, roughly the same number of angajari it made last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx gained $692 million, or 6 cents per share, from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the survey by Zacks expected the total of $12.23 billion.
FedEx's parent company has been hit in recent years by a decline in its prioritare international transporturile, which led to stagnant revenue reported by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping saluted the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the ground operations division grew 29 percent but operating revenues essentially staggered because of higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit posted a rise in revenues due to higher base charges, while revenue reported by the freight division fell because of rising costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares were down $3.85 or 2.5 percent at $150.15.
Wednesday's closing prices were down 11 percent at the close and 17 percent from their record high on June 11.
With the most anticipated meeting in years, officials with the administration's policy making decisions this week around a Honduran mahon table with 27 feet to decide whether it came time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
grimly, at one end of the central bank's meeting room, is to intonate a mural of the United States.
The map is designed to reamintesc that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed Chairman, and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Federal Reserve has received a double task from Congress: maximize the job growth rate in the U.S. and maintain price stability.
But since the big economic downturn, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unmet task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the X factor in a decision too difficult to predict, which will be announced Wednesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be disbanded by the unwelcome boost offered by the interest rate on interest rates nearly zero in place as of the end of 2008.
Even though most data indicate a strong economy, recent agitatia on global financial markets could spert Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by raising the base rate to federal funds - even just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Clearly, the housing market and inflation will be the first and chief issues they will pursue," stated Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the investment firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I also believe that if they looked for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the growing uncertainty on the world market is sufficient to offer them arguments to wait longer," she told reporters.
There is no consensus over the decision the Fed will make, this in itself causing instability on the financial system.
About two-thirds of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a rate cut this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay, with a key indicator showing the likelihood of growth is only 30 percent.
This would indicate a fall on the stock market if the Fed raises interest rates, excluding those who were writing the policies would ease the blow promising it would be much longer to the next increase.
Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228,89, or 1.4 percent, to 16,599.85.
The growth was triggered by expectations Fed policy makers would keep interest rates stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for the Fed to raise interest rates this time," said Lonski.
If Fed policy makers did so, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets."
Other experts said a rate cut would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about the time the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to raise its rate by 0.25 percent this month, the first small step toward slowing the pace of monetary recovery that would confirm the strength of US recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite raised objections by Democrats such that there would be more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed in August, the job market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level seen by the Fed as total job ocupare.
Financial gains showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to not hit the central bank's annual target, Fed policy makers stated that a key reason was the temporary effect of oil prices in sudden decline.
The economy "can make up for higher rates and has to be kept, given the tension on the job market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets at the time began to go fiberglass at the end of this month after China devalorized its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16 percent below its record peak hit in May because investors feared the slowing Chinese economy would drag down world growth.
The market has receded somewhat this month, with the Dow index now about 10 percent below its May peak.
For Fed policy makers, the agitatia on the market adds to complex calculation of the time rate increase.
"Without what has happened on financial markets and news of the weakening Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be more fervent during the session," stated Stephen D. Oliner, a researcher with the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he predicts they will wait at least a month to handle the effects better.
"There is very much uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy and they almost have no data on which to rely later on China events," said Oliner.
Bunning the global economy is not one of the Fed's major interests, so virtually no should be taken into account in taking decisions.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority at the moment.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
Simpbling reference by then Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in April that the Fed might "narrow" its monetary expansions triggered the earthquake on the credit markets.
In a world where markets and economies are ingusted out of control, it is likely Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decizional process is "more art than science," stated Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department of the firm's management of the prosperity business Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "the Fed has a supradimposition of supradimensiv response to changes on the financial markets that appear to have nothing to do with the economic bazele."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, a body with a role to rule on interest rates, provided as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that has affected Asia has forced the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percent in three meetings, "despite the implications with limited identification for US development," said Lacker.
A year later, Fed officials returned to their respective declines.
The Fed should put financial stability first only in a major crisis, such as the 2008 credit crunch, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's stabilisation committee.
The last busy period is no longer up to the mark, he stated.
"With no doubt we're not looking to get in the position of worried about a rate cut because they were angry markets," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve's act holds double the mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes about it, I don't think they should take the lead premature.

Seven's Sunrise dominate polls despite attempts by Nine network to broadcast in Today's show about changing party leadership

4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at Nepal protesters
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepali after police fired rubber bullets into the crowd demonstra against the proposed new constitution, an official said Tuesday.
The violence happened Wednesday night in the district of Rupandehi, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district-control officer, more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cockroaches.
Dl. Dhakal stated that police force used tear gas after firing shots into the air before resorting to using cauciuc force.
After his words, there were douazeci police officers and five civilians.
It was not immediately clear why the cauciuc gloMount, which it is known to kill but is usually used as a less letterhead alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest event after weeks of violent protests conducted in the southern Nepali region, where members of the ethnic Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established in the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also been held in western Nepali, where the ethnic Tharus group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes sparked on August 10,
When four key political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, the country ruled at the central government for hundreds of years.
The process of writing a new constitutions was begun in 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week in Kathmandu, legislators voted for clocks in the constitution and officials said the new carrot could be passed Sunday.

NHC reports 60 percent ciclon storm surge south of Cape Verde
A massive low-pressure storm system about 560 km south of the most suave point of the Cape Verde Islands presents a 60 percent chance of turning into tropical storms over the next 48 hours, the US national center said Wednesday.
Another well-defined low pressure front about the size of Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles likely presents a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical storm over the next two days, the Miami ologist added.
Chirurgical weight loss may be useful in diabetics with easy obesity
The benefits of weight loss surgery in people with easy, type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetics with easy obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are undergoing necrophonical treatments.
"It is time to centralize data on mortality," said Dr Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, car finance, car she wrote an article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
The procedures for weight loss, also called bariatrical surgery, use various methods to micromanage the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb foods.
Over the years, bariatrical surgery has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (IMC) 35 or superior.
IMC, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the 18.5-24.9 range.
IMC's IMC score of at least 25 indicates a person is supraponderal and people with IMC above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate IMCs accesand: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the General Min-Sheng Hospital of Taiwan used data gathered after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatrical surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in mankind - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes to people with easy obesity.
The average IMC for people undergoing surgery fell from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Between the two, IMC at people receiving nechirurgical treatments against diabetic diabetes remained nearly the same, and anume 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetics completely vindecat at 36 percent and partially at 28 percent.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetics fully vindecat at only 1% and partly to only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and LDL "bad cholesterol" were generally better in the surgical group, "the authors concluded.
Researchers reportedly monitored blood pressure levels of the A1c hemp, which reflects blood pressure in time.
Researchers write that the optimal hemoglobines of A1c are below 7 percent.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobinic A1c levels declined from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
But in the group treated by medical methods, it held at around 8 percent.
But this improved "blood pressure control" - reflected by improved levels of A1c hemoglobines - did not reduce the death rate to five years, according to lead researcher Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team reportedly compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the group with gastrectomy in manic manic surgery, the group with bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), reported more considerable declines in IMC's value (7.4 compared to 5.1%) and hemoglobines A1c (3.1% compared to 2.1%) and showed a higher probiotic remission of diabetic diabetes (46.9% compared to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of large people in Sweden that surgical intervention prelungeste life, says Blackstone, of Arizona's University of Arizona Medical Center - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, overweight people who underwent bariatrical surgery showed a roughly 29 percent lower risk of dying after 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate an increase in survival at patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone stated that it was an optimistic aspect for people with IMC under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the point where this paper is critical because it says that surgery is safe in the group with inferior IMC," without raising the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should begin -taking their weight into account when the patient's IMCG reaches 27-30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we urge people to take this aspect seriously," she stated.
"I think once they accumulated these genetic changes that scurtcircuited their bodies predisposed to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely hard to get back to normal."
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe may not welcome all refugees, the Dalai Lama told reporters, adding that the real solution to the current crisis is in the Middle East.
The tidal Buddhist leader delivered a call for putting an end to violence in the mother of the world's refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current crisis in the speech he delivered at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, devoted to ethics studies, at the start of his 10-day trip to Britain.
He stated that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even every continent.
He stressed too that while admirable, the response of western countries to the crisis was insensitive to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he told reporters in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to make the most of the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful care for a few thousand refugees, but we must look in the same way to find solutions on the ground to bring peace and sincere development, particularly through education, to Muslim countries," he stressed.
In fact, we need to look at ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
"The force has never resolved these issues," he added.
Speaking about the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama reportedly commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attacks on September 11, saying violent response from the U.S. generated a chain of incontrollable events.
"After the events of September 11, we sent the condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence."
"I know his reasons were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama stated.
Growth four times in children ingested cleaning detergent over 4 years
According to Georgia's anti-poisoning center, anti-poisoning centers in the U.S. reported an increase of approximately 400 percent beginning in 2010 in the number of children aged under 12 who swallowed cleaning hands detergent with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez, the director of Georgia's anti-poisoning centre, cases of hand soap poisoning to children aged under 12 reported at anti-poisoning centres jumped from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2006.
"Children have more frequently access to these products and, of course, a lot of them arrive at the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some kids deliberately drink detergent and others do it to impress friends or answer challenges on social networking sites.
On YouTube can be viewed films showing teens drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
It is believed that the youths mixed the detergents with alcohol to get a harder drink.
Children younger can be attracted by the attractive smell of detergents.
"A kid doesn't think it's doing him harm," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are parfumed ones.
Detergent hands with the flavor of capsuni, strugglers, portocals are the most attractive for children.
Detergent hand contains approximately 45-95 percent alcohol.
Especially at small children, only a few inghitituri can cause poisoning with alcohol.
"It is very focused alcohol," Dr Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning centre in Kansas City, told the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
Instead, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in affordable places and if the kids get to them, this is a quick way to consume much alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a 13-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four hand soap pulverisers with the flavor of capsuni, arrived at the emergency room to get treatment.
He had alcoolemia179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr Chris Ritchey, a doctor at the emergency room who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah balked and couldn't go when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her over the weekend in a separate child care unit to identify signs of brain damage because the girl fell and hit her head from alcohol, said Ritchey.
"It was frightening," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use products or dry servings without alcohol and not leave hand detergents at the hands of children.
Besides poisoning alcohol, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In April, two Ontario women died after they swallowed cleaning hand detergent that contained a toxic, nedeclarered ingredient.
Health officials assumed the product contained metanol, a lettuce, and not etil alcohol, stated as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in northern New York complied to poisoning their "bad" teacher "putting antibacterious products in the class," according to a police report.
The teacher is very sensitive to hand detergent and banned him in his class.
Police felt the plan was "unworkable" and referred the disciplinary matter to the inspectorate.

Griffiths demonises rumors of disputes
There have been rumours of disputes at Celtic, demonised by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure having been preparing to face the leaders of the Dutch league.
"I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players just wait.
Absence of scovering in title race gets Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtic - because they were not competing for the title against Rangers.
De Boer, currently the Ajax ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands they never deliver the rezumate of Celtic games; why?"
For example, there aren't the Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the Rangers' return.
"It's about Old Firm.
"It's all about both teams together and there is interest.
The tension is high in Old Firm games and not only do the scoresheet want to see these games.
I will change the situation, "DeYoung promises.
RONNY Deila accepted Celtic were struggling from the start but the Norwegian boss vowed to change the situation.
The defeat to Malmo and subsequent exit from the Champions League were followed by defeat to Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now in the top flight with a seven-point lead.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had periods before and will recover."
"We look forward to getting out as quickly as we can of this situation."
"I know it is very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or trampled about what is going on.
Just feel we feel it - but we need to go back.
"We definitely have to get the support of Celtic because eventually and the players become better.
"It is extremely important to stay united now."
Prudence to Warburton on January moves
Despite comments in the early hours that suggested he may have identified several targets for January moves, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is preoccupied when it comes to transferuri, insisting he does not want to damage Ibrox's unity.
The former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer."
In the cases of players signed last summer, there is the period prior to the season when they can be integrated, something you could see this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more damage if you bring players who aren't needed.
Celtic target Michal after retirement
Strikerman Swansea's Michal, associated with Celtic during the transfer window, suggested he may retire at the end of his contract with the Ut.
The 38-year-old has been struggling for two years with knee problems and failed to leave Tara Galilor in the summer.
Hearts face SFA over Neilson comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was eliminat and they lost 3-2, but the defender's red card was then overturned - the third yellow card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson keeps his comments, insisting: "We have not put at risk my integrity, we have not commented about performance."
Griffiths jappeals to avoid Tynecastle
The Hibee was taken to the streets after admitting to singing a song with often-offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2006 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh ahead of a derby against Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was the derby and there was the enthusiasm of the moment," said the strikerman, adding: "There is no need to say I'm not back at Tynecastle until I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council has confidence in Dundee United management - Donnelly

"We will bring out the guys in," said Donnelly.
McInnes happy for "dirty" win over Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits the Aberdeen side must agitate their own to Hamilton Accies to secure their eighth successive league win, which has handed them five points over Celtic thanks to the penalty kick in the first half executed by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in the cupa or league, and who have not won games like this."

During these 12 months, we have observed improvements on the Scottish labour market, with the employment rate experiencing growth and the unemployment rate falling.
Why am I a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
"Late on Friday, excluding a tarnished legal intervention, I will look at how a man is sentenced to death."
If it happens, and hopefully it doesn't happen, I will sit in a room for observers in the state prison room and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administered the lettuce injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and, although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day with the news approaches, I'm terrified of the idea.
So, why do I do it?
I was right because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because usually applications exceed the number of seats available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
Those elected will view the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, in addition I developed my own connection to him over the lunea of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two hours and a half.
I like the type.
"We often talk long when we talk.
penitenciars say they can also be witness and journalist, so I'm not going to allow myself to have to have my carry-on and a piecemeal watch to note what I see.
"I will have to try to remember all the details."
An Oklahoma reporter accused me on the Web of compromises my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, getting access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he "could have formula better," but is in the mood to argue that they were wrong.
Richard Glossip was not to say some of the things I said and wrote.
"He doesn't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it either if he asked me.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he is looking forward to being a leading international report that will write about the subject.
Crede that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files we've made.
I will not be here to comment on all the details.
"I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of conspiracy.
But I think he is very likely not to be guilty of murder. "
"I think with certainty there were not enough evidence to justify the death penalty."
"I think his execution is wrong.
And I will look at him dying from this perspective.
"I can't claim to be totally objective.
For this, visit the articles written by other reporters.
From me you will learn how to view a man I love murit unnecessary.
Peter Moody claims steelworkers tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from the races
Peter Moody stated that Racing Victoria stewardesses tried to inhibit a spoil at his grajd last year and threatened to immediately withdraw from the races.
He launched an attack against steelworkers and Racing Victoria's integrity unit, saying they were running a personal campaign against him, the picatura that filled the paharul being the withdrawal of Lady Tatley from the race because of a treatment administered the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what was best for the cursory field of curses and that he was put in a difficult position when it came to the positive test for Lidari's cobalt, for which he had no explanation.
For 18 months he inghitit his words about the spionage and did not want to associate himself with the "vulture that doesn't get the grapes."
"I had nothing to say about that aspect and I have tacut long enough but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything rabbles from one place," Moody stated.
It is known that he continued.
Sometimes you react and you must bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have said.
Dismissed me home and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head sus and I wish the owners with whom I work would see me struggling to offer them everything that is right. "
From the moment they start to think it's not going to happen, I need to stop working on my trainer's job.
"In that time I will have to think what I will do with my certification.
Earlier this year, Moody threw the bomba in an interview given to racing.com in which he said the ethics department tried to spy on his grajduri.
"In the early optsprezece months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whose name I will tell you if I am asked - and offered to hire him at my grajduri to supply information about the business there," Moody told Racing.com.
Apparently he considers me a trite.
If so, then they should all give up their jobs because they were incompetenti in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL chairman, David Moodie, current RVL chairman and Bernard Saundry, the current executive vice president of RVL, knew at the time and they know again today.
Should I think it is personal?
Does it really mean that RVL will start to have coloana vertebrala and perhaps draw on people outside the trainee for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
So bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe so do the others.
Maybe they need to take my licence and get me to a good deal and I have doubts that the comments I make now might lead them to think about the option.
I've also got to the point where I don't care and that causes me concerned.
"It really intristates me.
I will put pressure on them and force them to take a stand. "
My family supports me and I can leave.
Frustration with the trainee grew once the lengthy investigation into the cobalt testing involving Lidari was involved and the suspension led him to claim he could "put his licence on the line."
Moody, whose name is most commonly associated with training the untrained Black Caviar champion, labeled the treatment rule of the day's race as "riddled" after he applied on the horses' feet a cath of name-brand namesake or argila, which violates the rules.
incalculable rules of curses.
I must take full responsibility for this, "he says.
One of my employees put out nameless namesake on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It may have happened yesterday, which was what happened.
It happened the day of the race.
Moody could be despenalized for three months for treatment from the day of the race constand in applying cat-eye cream, for which steelworkers have opened an investigation.
It is a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We understand with the rules that it is time for rules but it has gone too far," Moody stated.
driver who hit and ran from the scene in Coburg has been arrested
Police have arrested a man after a collision with a biciclet in Coburg at the end of the week and followed by the fuga from the scene.
Bicycle driver was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, seriously injured after being hit by a car Saturday morning on Murray Valley Road.
Police officials declared the vehicle driver did not stop to help the injured biciclist-driver.
Monday, a 50 year old man, has been reporting on to Shepparton police.
It is believed he will be charged with fugit from the scene, failing to provide first aid and other road offences.
Bicycle driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized, in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is addressing opponents in wrestling charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called criticism of placid tactics used by his team as "denounce" issues brought up by the two main opposition NRL rivals.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referee allowed the Storm players to "take the trite" of their team in the angry win over Storm in the qualifying final Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to the Storm after their team's victory in the qualifying match against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "demonstration" of the rugby league league league and said the two Queensland sides were not really pricep to wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in on placid tactics addressed by his team and said the players were simply focusing on "contact" when placating.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two key coaches criticised his team, which means they were concerned the Storm would defeat them.
"And things aren't over here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy told reporters Tuesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything all year in our systems or defensive techniques, so only in the past six weeks have we put the emphasis indeed on contact in placings and thus changed the situation.
Trent is in this position for three years and in a way he has a wonderful team so he probably is not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
Nowhere is it always going to be this time of year.
Bellamy backed Bennett's idea of "animating football," recounting his St George-Illawarra Dragons' win in 2010 playing "boring football."
Wayne talks about palpitant football.
"He explained his view comparing Saturday night's game to Friday night's game and he spoke about how paltry the game was," Bellamy stated.
I remember in 2010, St George got many criticism for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care any more than how long under the unghie.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider to be paltry football, particularly thanks to young young mijlocasii.
"The gist of the game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his playing style - not any team has two mijlocasii like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to help play like that.
"mie gives me more confidence because they are saying these things because they are somewhat concerned about the game.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy meanwhile pulled the plug on the Storm and Roosters game was a more fierce battle about the scores compared with the Broncos and Cowboys game.
Broncos' game was probably a good game, we haven't seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two attempts, that means paltry play?
Or palpitant means making breaks and not scoring?
For me there are plans.
If I talk about ourselves, it means at some point we could meet them.
Storm have the free agency this week because they have won the right to play home either against the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in Saturday's qualifying final at AAMI Park with tickets set to go on sale starting next Wednesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used fetal phone to lure pedofili to send images
A pedofil was using the phone of a 10-year-old to demand images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was sleeping then signed into an online mesagerie service where another user sent her a series of inappropriate images of children as the subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he slept.
He looked into the phone and found the disturbing messages after he immediately alerted his mother.
After the arrival, police saw the five pictures then examined computers found at the address and found "troubling" searches on the Internet using terms to find inappropriate images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did so to "attract pedophiles" to the Internet before "claiming to be a police officer to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: "He said it was a addiction - that he was dependent on scare people.
He admitted he made the searches on his computer but said he did so because he wanted to get a police officer to speritate the pedofili.
He was asked about conversations conducted with the unidentified person who sent him the footage and about asking the person to also send him further pictures.
He said he did it to lure.
He said he never thought clearly when he was drinking and that he wanted to see images of rape and crime.
Mr Robertson added: "When the baby found the messages on the phone, she screamed at her mother and trembled and crying.
The girl saw the explicit images on the phone and the accused was faced.
The girl was interviewed and testified that the accused used the computer and Playstationers to speak to girls who seemed far younger than him.
Last June, Hogg, 23, based in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded not guilty to charges that he produced or made indecent pictures of child subjects, and violated the terms of his release on January 25 this year and failed to appear in court at the hearing March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be registered in the sexually explicit register because it can be claimed that the crime "did not involve a significant sexual aspect."
Judge Alistair Carmichael delayed the verdict until October for social workers' reasons.
Hogg was released on bail in the case but remained in custody ahead of trial for other cases.
It was passed to the sexual offenders register before the verdict was given.
Robert Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, delivered wrong speech to Congress
At the start of the year, Dl Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
He was not injured but the footage of the fall became viral on the Web.
The opening of the parliamentary session was reportedly disrupted by opposition officials who stated they had received anonymous death threats, threatening not to huiduie Mr Mugabe on the eve of his speech.
Last month they booed him during his speech in Congress - a speech he repeated Wednesday.
The head of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, warned not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but is titled" death, "he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns MPs in question that the immunity applies only to the Commons and once they leave the Commons, parliamentary immunity no longer has value.
The parliamentary group's head said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats being sent to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 20,000 layoffs
It is projected Hewlett-Packard will make between 30,000 and 20,000 layoffs as part of the company's restructuring and reduction efforts in the service sector.
This year... HP will split the stock into two companies, separating its computer and imprimante division from corporate-services and services businesses in fully-integrated demand.
The planned cuts will bring costs of approximately $2.7 billion beginning in the fourth quarter, said HP.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise structure more competitive and more sustainable in terms of costs," said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP currently and will hold a broad portfolio of business that will contribute to the transition of businesses to the new business style of running business," Whitman stated.
functioneaza as a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing demands of our customers at the same time. "
According to a company filing, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and "focus on providing integrated solutions without rival" targeted to companies.
It is scaring a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, having been the business of producing electric equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the "Silicon Valley league-uri."
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's fourth-largest computer maker and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the latest in the industry, based on the idea that firms that focus their attention better in a direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
Absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men hitting their peak for 15 years.
In April, suicide accounted for the leading cause of death among 20-45 men in Britain, and remains three times more frequent among men than women.
In an effort to tackle the issue, the campaign against unequal living (Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2007 as the Year of Barbarians, seeking to put the culture that prevent men from seeking help when they have to.
The friendship lies in the center of the struggle to achieve this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2000 college students showing depression symptoms concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy mood," his recovery chances are increasing.
In the same way, for people who are not deformed, a circle of healthy mental friends reduces the likelihood of developing mental disorders.
Unfortunately, for friendship to have effect, this must in part be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networking sites, where the emphasis is on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priority over contact with significance.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong, open figure to fun and success, even if in reality isolation is the one that dominate.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinseca values; money, image, social status, all with the cost of intrusive values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - that further affects our mental health.
Inventatorul miliardar Prconduct of a video game recently explained that money actually doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it turned the spotlight on the idea.
The characters were not defined by their job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
Ummaline frequent imbratisations of Joey and Chandler, the moments when he looks at football in his comfy fotoland Ross's passion for Rachel came from knowing that men can assimilate with the situation, even though often they are shy about fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained: "... my job of listening to people with a tendency to suicide and degenerate showed how even the smallest interactions with friends can make difference."
Often, people who rely on us don't feel capable of speaking to friends.
Vital zicala to deal with yourself is strong, just like the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the serials that come to mind when I try to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms on the ground.
Serial has pulled together the little moments of friendship between men.
Whatever the objective, external intervention, means by phone, people reach moments of desperation, support on the part of the family and close friends.
Instead, if you're participating this past week at FriendsFest sponsored by Comedy Central, with full redacted set of filmare to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and salutat.
It's never known what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - with # FriendsFest.
Di Maria scores and helps PSG give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Wednesday in his Champions League debut and helped PSG hold off Swedish side Malmo.
In the meantime we will be showing the cronica of the game and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their part, with Paris Saint-Germain beginning their Champions League qualifying campaign with a quiet 2-0 win over Malmo in Wednesday's match on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his Champions League debut in the PSG side, bringing the French champions into the lead although they missed a couple of chances before securing their lead with the goal by Cavani in the 61 minutes.
Once in Group A with Real Madrid and Sahtior Donetk, Paris had to start strong against the Swedish champions because the French team's goal is not only qualifying for the finals but also an improvement in parity to the finals in each of their last three tournaments.
But while taking the points, Laurent Blanc's men were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasted the opening goal after being replaced by the club in his native town and the club at which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win away or away in the Champions League, so the 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable lead over the next clasate, even though there are still aspects we need to improve over the season," Blanc declared.
It is a good sign.
"We were looking to win and we did, although I feel we were not able to get one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic recovered from injury to one of three changes to the Paris club with a 2-2 draw away to Bordeaux in the Premier League last weekend, but Di Maria took the lead in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was signed from Manchester United, the Argentine defensive midfielder was named the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he tasked at Marco Verratti's cross behind Malmo's defence before uriating repeatedly past Johan Wiland in the left corner of the far post.
But if anyone expected PSG to achieve the victory pocking their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-off to reach the final this weekend and went on to win nine points at national teams with a defence of five men and two defensivi mijlocasii, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, save for Nikola Djurdjic's cross that cleared Kevin Trapp's post in the fourth minute.
In fact, PSG players slowed the pace several times, giving up several unnecessary passes and not fining their interventiile, even Ibrahimovic who missed no more than five attempts only in the first half and was then replaced by Cavani right after the start of the game.
Ibrahimovic was also far more priceput in supporting his teammates, with his cross the one Di Maria sent in a low cross by Wiland over the bar in the 52 th minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after a half hour gone, thanks to Cavani, the uruguayian who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic pasa from Maxwell's cross.
That goal eliminated the Malmo hopes of rewriting the game and only a superb Wiland from close range for David Luiz's respingerea of the ball maintained the final score before new signing Ezequiel Lavezzi was awarded a penalty in the prelungiri.
Malmo's coach Age Hareide later stated that PSG were a class above and that "the last game we played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Sweden league, which is not up to the same standard.
Calm is not enough.
Jos the palette for PSG.
They did an excellent job.

Talks between Prime Minister Gordon Brown and union leaders have reached no conclusion, with the Government proposing a 10% pay rise, from 1 December 2008, with payment on 1 January 2008, and unions seeking a 15% rise, from November, or a 20% rise, from December.
The talks took place at the White House on Wednesday night, with the Prime Minister accompanied by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Chancellor Alistair Darling and Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
The Government proposal today did not please us, otherwise we would not have got in the position to call the conductors of our federations.
The 10 percent that we were promised today represents for us less than what we expected.

What's wrong with coach Darren Cahill?
She is in the middle of a crucial decision for her career, having been forced to choose whether to continue or not to work with coach Darren Cahill.
The pair have been working this year under the Adidas Player Development programme, with the Australian coach working with the American only at key tournaments.
She had mostly words of advice to Cahill, who seems the only coach able to break off the capriciously athletic Sharapova.
Adidas' schedule will also end at the end of this year, and she must decide whether to offer a consistent contract to Cahill or whether to end her collaboration.
We don't yet know exactly what will happen. "
We talk and see.
"After Singapore I'll be able to give a response," she confessed during a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in the current game, asking for a contract of around £1 million a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a meserie to which he wouldn't want to quit in the moment.
The last event at which she and Cahill will work together is the U.S. Open, in Singapore.
"It wasn't normal, I wasn't being respected.
Mr Brown revealed how he split from the England team last autumn.
The former coach confessed that he had not spoken to FRF president Razvan Burleanu after he took over for Mr Sandu, and instead took the decision to leave the national team.
In the end, he offered the head of the union substantial pay to stay, but was denied.
"In the moment I don't feel like I left the team.
Then I felt sorry, we left a lot behind.
So I felt then it was good for me and I think it was good for me. "
"What was happening when I was coach, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I wasn't being respected.
"I worked well with the guys before the Federations but when he came to the Federations he came up with a preconceputa idea, he didn't know me, he was hearing different opinions from the media about me.
It didn't change me because it was really hard in that time, with the results I had, plus there was financial situation at stake.
"We continued our work, everything really worked out and he probably had changed his ideas."
But I wanted myself to leave.
If he wanted to stay neaparat, I then offered a contract extension.
We have around £400 and £500 a year, we were going to have around £600.
"I didn't talk to him, but his left hand.
"It was right, but mostly if we finish first in the group," Mr Piturca said on BBC Radio 4.
Victor Piturca resigned from England's national team last autumn, although the team had good results in Euro 2008 qualifying.
The coach accepted the offer to coach in Saudi Arabia, immediately preaching the Al Ittihad club.

When he saw his wife's filming of him, the Columbus, Ohio, man simply didn't recunoscut: "I looked in my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was terrible, I didn't remember anything. '
In addition, his wife, who, while she was doubts about it, in turn went with him to nenumarati doctors, remembers Nick's breathing elling a alcohol.

BBC's pay report rejected in committees: Sir Menzies faces quit
House Democratic leaders on Tuesday rejected the White House's report on Iraq.
To reject the report voted 17 Democrats, one against the rejection (Sen. Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The draft report will be submitted to the full House.
They will decide, probably next week.
At the next full plenul will be debated.
"I think given this situation it will be done relatively quickly," Senate Democratic Leader Georgie Severin said.
He added that "it was of good use" for the BBC's management to be present at the meeting, as the culture Comistank was not a representative of the BBC's management.
"It was of good use to be the BBC leadership because nobody here was subjected to personal attacks or something like that."
The invitation was made to board members earlier tonight, with a aproximtime that we didn't know any of us, but today, after the meeting of the joint committee, I personally sent a fax to the BBC board invitating her.
I think as you're called, you're a government employee, paid out public services and you're called to a meeting of the joint committees even if you don't like coming back.
"Because it's your duty of service, you're in an institution in charge of the Congress," Severin said after the House of Representatives' annual culture committee meeting.
He added that during the meeting the agency's financial aspects were discussed on the negative report of the finance committees.
"The debts we saw again as they continued, there was the idea that on this year it would have been at the top but they had not paid out the historical ones."
"I reamintesc that not because of my or any other person in these committees was that agrement with banks and the fiscally responsible, there are clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the report was rejected by the full assembly there would be elections for a new General Assembly, and it would choose the chief executive.
I don't know who will be proposed for the job.
Minutemen aren't going to make it.
The key is to take political action to ensure that this institution operates.
"I'm not the guy to lying to you, to tell me there will be a genius standing up here and he's going to be running.
I hope those who decide, the House of Lords, by their vote will choose with lots of logic the people who will run the BBC.
"They need people who know what's going on there, have experience and have lots of integrity and respect for the institution and tradition."
I don't know who will be, unless you ask me what qualities they need - good will in attitude towards workers because it is a malfunction of complaints coming from employees, complaints, layoffs.
"When you get such complaints 50, 60, 70, something's putative and you're talking about financial situation that is a disaster," the panel's chairman concluded.
While not showing up for the Senate, House Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asking that Congress have a series of steps that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of public service, among them the indexation of the TV tax.
In the letter, Mr. Thompson is seeking, along with indexing the TV tax, to change and completarea the Company's 978 / 2003 tax law on the basis of the changes to the technology changes at the time, as well as to reglementarea the process on the payment of TV advertising and the finding of contraventiile and the penalty and penalties.
Also seeking to issue a order precluding the expansion of the obligation for all power suppliers to become mandates of the BBC to collect the licence fee by engaging the ANRE in regulation of the activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a maximal maximum of 5 percent of the commission on the payments.
Mr. Thompson is calling for the reduction in the tax rate for specific public service and contributions for the CNC from 15 percent to the level of 3 percent, but also for changing the 41 percent of the state's ban on receiving federal grants / funding to purchase licenses for major cultural and sporting events - the World Cup, Cerberus, Eurovision.
He argues that the BBC will go on strike over the next few months given that work law requires the employer to put in place judecatoresti orders, even if they are not definitive, and that pay rights are onerous to any other obligation.
The BBC Trust has consistently made efforts to reduce staff and TV production.
"Instead were travel and other activities generatoare of costs, were renegotiated a number of commercial contracts, and at the end of July the BBC News website was closed," the BBC's letter said.
Mr. Tanase notes that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only through its own efforts.
"Without the support of the state's agencies - the administration, Congress, the BBC - the BBC will, sooner or later, be in imposibilitatea of ever fulfilling its public duty," it states.
House leadership decided to send the letter to the committee.

According to the AP, there were 290 votes "for" and 108 "against."
The vote was secret, with buletinul.
Democratic officials were the only ones voting against the proposal, the Post said.
Of course, Democrats criticized Craig's appointment to the Senate and said they would challenge it to the court, as he has a federal case but does not have the training and experience.
Mr. Craig has 30 days to comply under the law, because his new Senate seat does not allow him to do politics.
The senator will serve as chairman of the Federal Election Commission, left free after John Paul was reviled as part of a September 2006 Supreme Court ruling that found he had been appointed unconstitutional.
Surpriza from one of the most sexy actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is to play a cook in the movie "Burnt," the actor made a disclosure to which his fists weren't expecting.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: "I've worked great part of my life as a cook."
He revealed he worked in the kitchen early at 15, when he was working for a Greek restaurant, for then, in college, to continue on the same path.
The actor explained his mother had Italian roots, so his entire childhood cooked with the Italian grandmother, ContactMusic reported.
Asked what plans for the future he had during that time, Bradley Cooper said he never was the type of guy to make plans on five years, "either."
"It's not really motivating me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you would laugh at if you were saying," he said, but also saying what he wanted from childhood had ended.
Now at age 40, the actor also admitted he sees the near future filming, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who got into the acting all at this age.
Bush accused of necontrolat calomnioase comments and irrational claims
ungar Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto sharply condemned the British Prime Minister's comments on Tuesday morning that political decliners in Hungary were "no better than those in Iraq, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee."
"Yesterday, Mr Bush lost his self-confidence and, by his irrational remarks, is insulting the entire Ungarie," the ungar Foreign Minister told a statement.
European civilized politicians do not say such necontrolat rumours.
"His Remainances have one explanation: he has totally lost his support in the domestic politics of the United States," the ungar foreign minister added, according to MTI.
In a Wednesday night posting on the Web site, Prime Minister Gordon Brown stated he wanted to draw attention and punish the behavior of senior Kurdish government officials, which, in his view, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not wish to respond to challenges coming from some Kurdish government representatives.
"These are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in antisemitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the war on terror!" Bush said on the campaign trail.
The Scottish Prime Minister added that he was adeptul of rationale and sustainable solutions in the crisis, apreciind that the violence and aggressive laws would not solve the problem.
Sars, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality with no help will solve the problem - only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decidels no better than those in Iraq, Libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, sound and sustainable solutions and especially in superiority of European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is in complete contradictie with these goals and values!" the top British government stressed.
Earlier Wednesday, ungar Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called as "simple lies" the Prime Minister's comments about the handling by Hungary of the crisis, apreciind that the words were unsuitable for a leader from the 20th century, according to MTI.
The head of the ungare foreign policy also noted Wednesday that the "extremist and false comments" by the British prime minister related to the domestic political crisis in Romania and said Budapesta was waiting for scuze from the American side.
Szijjarto was referring to a statement Monday by Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
"What I've said and always say is I am against the racist dissenting idea of closing the borders, that all the people coming are terrorists, they are Evul Mediu prostii and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people like people, not as we treat our maghiari neighbors, with their bata and indifference.
"With that I am not going to agree," the top U.S. diplomat stated in a telephone interview from Targu Jiu.
Meanwhile, Peter Szijjarto said the government of Budapesta had decided to begin preparations in the field for expanding to the border with Romania the wall it is building at the border with Serbia to make sure it was not a change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the decision by Ungariei to lift a fence to the borders did not solve anything of the crisis and "pull Hungary out of Europe."
What connection is there between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Mecca bridge?
Saudi authorities said Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, was "partially responsible" for the collapse of a bridge on Friday on the Saudi Grand Mosque in Mecca, an accident in which 107 people died.
According to an investigation committee, the company failed to "comply with safety standards," the Saudi state news agency (SPA) reported, the BBC reported.
The company's directors received interdictie to leave the country until the completion of their investigation into the incident.
Also, the firm will be barred from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of former al-Qaida terror leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father in the late 1980s and is currently run by the brother of the late terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 1 / 2 years on expanding the Great Mosque to help house more pilgrims.
The accident happened Friday night during a storm when a boat, probably disintegrated by strong winds, crashed on the eastern side of the Grand Mosque's roof.
In the crash, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi le-a shut down contestatarilor
Considered by much of the game the greatest Scottish football player in history, Mr Brown was etichetat, after his retirement, as a poor coach, who cannot be capable of achieving results again.
After unsettling experiences at the U.S. national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over as coach at Florida, the club he patronages.
After fix a year of taking over, King demonstrated he was capable of turning a team that was zbatut for playoff salvation into a top team.
Overall, after a year of the league, the Colts have recorded 16 wins, 11 losses and 11 losses.
The record is one of a top team, which is fighting for playoff spots.
Things have taken an even worse turn for the Colts this season, since the team reached second in the NFL with 19 points, one less than the league leaders.
Florida also has the league's best scoring defense with 20 (at home to Detroit), more than double the Yankees.
On Sunday, even though he brought up more experienced players, Hagi continued his policy of promoting young players, and over the past few years in the starting line-up have emerged names like Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy made the Viitorul a team to watch for overseas teams, so Hagi sold him for £1.5 million - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - £1 million) and John Mitrita (Bari - £500 million).
Along with the Patriots, the Colts are the only profitable team in the NFL, according to the league's Web site.
In the war on terror, the United States has so far played a small role.
It's a legitimate strategy, but after that you can't ask to be treated as the EU's eighth country.
Big countries are coming up with solutions for the entire EU, says Mr Ghosn, a member of the executive Colegiul director of the American Enterprise Institute.
In an interview, Mr Ghosn pointed out that Europe cannot be turned into a castle, and that purely politienesc means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come."
But there are masa that has started and we can't turn the tide.
Migrant trafficking is a reality to which we must adapt as best as we can and adapt them to us.
In Mr. Ghosn's view, we're in an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, the Europeans will not be willing to abandon free trade, but rules in the Schengen zone must be changed: "Schengen's now like an animal created in another era and that wasn't adapted for the situation now."
Where are we in the crisis after this JAI council which, of course, has not resolved anything?
It is clear that the EU president in agreement with Mr Tusk did not want to forgo a vote in the council.
All the pronosticurilor said he would have had the votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, in the JAI the principle of unanimity was against any state could block any decision.
Of course, things have been very little integrated into the justice and interior.
After Lisbon, it applies normal procedure, in which the EU has the initiative, and the council approves it with the votes of 55% of states, or 16, which represent 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it's a sensitive matter, there have been reactions of rejection even in Germany against Chancellor Angela Merkel's open door policy and they didn't want in many countries to emerge as a reaction to the "EU is sending us migrants on their head."
They have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because, in a way, this wave creates a huge problem for Schengen guvernation and we will probably witness big changes there over the coming months.
So the mandatory cotele have not been with the public, but the subject has just been allowed to get more dry?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater Frontex involvement in managing external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of the European agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also the border with Germany, de facto, and this surge has given the limits to the old Schengen system.
Maybe it's going to end the Dublin principle, that migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they first enter, because it's not sustainable.
If Greece cappoints, you can't say at all that it's the job of Greece.
The problem's common.
Tocmai because the problem is common, is there possible a resolution without a precise, perhaps even mandatory mechanism to share the burden of receiving aid?
Nobody knows exactly how the mandatory cotele will work, unless it is to get to them.
For example, there remains a problem: what do you do with a guy who doesn't want to come to the United States or Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European nations are going to start taking on migrants: you're going to be in the X or Y country.
Perhaps it's going to be some unique filtrare centers, in Greece or Turkey, where the applications will preside.
"They're working on solutions like this."
But the problem has no simple solution.
"There are countries that have tens of years of experience trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, like the United States, where the immigration issue will enhance the xenofob tide."
The fact is we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are sitting in prewar camps and who de-abia started heading for Europe.
An estimate says just 10 percent have yet to leave, winter's hard to cross the Mediterranean, but we expect next year a perhaps even bigger wave.
What do we do with these people?
My Pronoster is that we're going to obscurate this issue, we won't be looking at it so catastrophic from a media perspective.
Vorm countries with lower or greater experience.
Do you think there is any place where there has been a success with the integration of large groups coming from an extraEuropean culture?
I look at magrelish in France, the Turks in Germany, they are all enclaves.
"I wouldn't go toward radical statements.
"Certainly their integration's more difficult than in other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean they don't really integrate."
It has remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But purely politique means will not work.
To create a fortareata in Europe is iluzoriu.
It needs to run the mechanisms of integration in European societatile.
Here were some mistakes.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let's ask these people to learn English, try to take values, not just stay one foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of their family including marriage.
It also needs to separate this imminent issue of these people from the issue of integration.
If others failed in integration on the whole it does not mean we need to look at them as they are inequering in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come.
And if there is an intervention in Iraq, which I don't think, it doesn't mean that the country is going to rebuild over time and you can take them back. "
Until solutions emerge, we see fortareata within Europe.
"They have closed borders, they are building walls, they are reintroducing border controls into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such, not the Schengen zone as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and arranged the rules so pressure was too high on countries where they were putting foot first these migrants.
Or we drive freely from colo, but each one's got his own problems.
"In the face of such a wave it's not going to be that way because some countries are not doing it."
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show they are doing something, but on the whole it doesn't change much.
"After the attacks in France we don't have a much draconian terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
"There's a wave of public emotive fear that instalments in both directions."
And it is so instilled from one week to another that you can't take decisions on it.
We have lots of talking, lots of below-par statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virulent.
And, then, you have the dramatic case of the missing child in Turkey and the public is laughing.
"After the public emotion passes, we will be back to the reasons we created this space, this freedom of movement that isn't just for people, but also for property."
This's the real European single market.
And I don't think Europeans will abandon this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is different.
The Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that wasn't adapted for the situation now.
America how has it played out so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, which thinks if he draws sappire on his eyes and astride his ears, the theme disappear.
In the face of the reality of the surge in Front-border immigration, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your small country's problem.
We have done that, it's a legitimate strategy, but after that you can't ask to be treated as the EU's eighth largest country.
You're not, you don't play at high level.
"Big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we don't now discuss their quality.
As did Poland.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that Americans' appetite for Schengen will really decline.
"President Bush says it's maybe good that we didn't already go.
So we move from the desperation of entry to a more pragmatica position, but the goal remains.
There is obviously a risk if the UK and Bulgaria go into Schengen as migrants see us as the alternative route.
"That doesn't mean there's a reason not to go into Schengen, but to be more pragmatical."
The United States will be part of the Schengen zone, and the Schengen zone will exist but transformed in the sense that external borders will become shared responsibility, there will be unique immigration acceptance rules for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said after Russia moved its focus on Iraq to Ukraine there had never been anyone killed.
Is there a link between the two fires, a Russia game?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She thinks being a big power means incurring the Americans and the Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a link.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would have collapsed demult.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was Al Qaeda.
Vreo two years ago was a struggle between the Assad regime and moderate Sunni and Muslim Muslim milices, backed by the Gulf countries and the West.
Then Al Qaeda rose up and now we don't even know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia could complicit things but cannot participate in the solution.
She creates focuses of instability and chaos that she cannot shut down.
But you're great power only if you have the solutions.
The game at off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Perhaps Putin expects to be made offers, to press himself on the butoane to solve the situation.
The offers don't come because the world isn't convinced he can in some way or another address matters created all by him.
But I am not to dispute the tedious claims that these people are manicured by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What buton'll soon appear?
Milioane of Facebook users have used to the "Like" button, and now network officials are preparing another alternative, the "Dislike" button.
Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of the company, announced on his Web site that the button would soon be available, the New York Times said on its blog.
Zuckerberg said the "Dislike" button would show more a nuanta of what a user feels like than a simple option.
With his announcement, he raised the possibility that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg noted that he wanted to avoid the moments when someone posts on his account a significant event in life, and someone else would give "Dislike."
The network's users, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long requested to have their negative emotions express or sympathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said he was not very comfortable for people to give "Like" to current events, like the war in Iraq, or in a family member's death.
"It can't feel comfortable giving Like a Like to that comment," the Facebook representative noted.
The option of a new button on the Web has not been received well by everyone.
"There is already plenty of hate on the Web and on the Web," Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan commented on the New York Times Web site, where the article was posted.
"I will give 'Dislike' butts, '" he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, argued there was nothing wrong with the button, encouraging people to have different views on the Web.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at the eMarketer, noted that it is hard to imagine a single button can deliver a complex range of negative emotions.
More important, she argues, is the election campaign in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary within 24 hours
Hungary agreed Wednesday to accept only 70 migrants, a handful of thousands coming in by sea at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency late Friday in two states along the border with Serbia, shutting down a main border crossing and announcing it would build a fence at its border with Romania, the daily reports.
The move drew a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Even yesterday they said they would sigh the border for those who want to cross but not for those seeking asylum.
"As you see it, this is totally different," said Serbian minister for refugees Aleksandar Vulin.
Before imposing the new immigration law, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary Sunday, police said.
Also, more than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2007.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
"The new" state's headquarters stand to picket.
Two contractors in trouble
The massive investments here in recent years in order to move the agency, stand to be darn to close because they have been stopped twice.
Two key contractors who worked here went missing during construction.
The State House headquarters in East Orange will get darn to darken itself.
A year and a half after construction and reorganization work had failed to get the building completed, the work has not come to a close.
A final stage in the building's epochal trial was over last week when the National Development Corporation (CNC) rejected a lawsuit by the firm that wanted to take over the technical work for the work to be done.
The initial project was prepared by Romcatel Impex SA.
Following the contractor's entry and the suspension of work, there were negotiations to begin without the publication of a tender offer with Impex Romcatel, with the firm to update the technical work, and then be held a new auction for work.
"The negotiations have also not concluded through a contract, with the county apreciind that the proposed form would have favored the agency," rezumat Mr. Timofciuc, a public relations representative in the state.
The county's decision to suspend direct negotiations was appealed to the Romcatel Impex.
The D.C. court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it, as tarnished.
This also does not mean the county can begin the search for another contractor.
Romcatel Impex has the option to appeal the CNSC decision to the High Court, only after a final ruling of its own could take the lead in finding another contractor.
Instead, building work could be resumed as early as next year.
Our Intent is to restart work as soon as possible. "
In principle, rebuilding the technical project should not last long, but we need to get a contract done.
"We're waiting to see whether the CNC's decision will be appealed or not," Timofte said.
Work to rebuild the former Chestnut Street office began in 2011.
A first contract was terminated in April 2012 after it was running for £4.5 million.
The auction was resumed, with the contract being adjudecat by Moldoconstruct SA.
The firm also went public, with that contract ending after it was making payments of £1.5 million.
Work has so far been completed in proportie of approximately 50%.
Initially, building, remodeling and mansardation work had been valued at $7.7 million.
"Gata, I say all!" - the statement that might incur the former cadet's former cadet
One of the employees involved in the scandalous case at the U.S. Department of Justice signed a plea agreement for the death penalty.
Most of his comments will incur the other accused, in frunte with former boss Narcisa Nedelcu.
A senior official from the United States Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in Washington accused by the FBI in a federal investigation has admitted faking his fap.
The agreement on recognition of the facts signed by Mr Dascalu was registered yesterday at the High Court, with the jury set to give a decision in the case on 29 September.
Mr McDaniel was charged with aggravated aggravated aggravated battery and was ordered to serve two years in dischisment with delay, as well as community service.
In connection with the charges imputed to Dascalu, the indictment said he, as a state office assistant, with several other colleagues, "allegedly prepared in fals more than a dozen approved form processions, pri alizing the contract acts in chain-of-contract with the O.C.P.I. 's directors, the Gauss' firms, the SC Group of Five, the Topo Euro Cad Company, the State Department of Ca dents and Topography, which allegedly stated that the services were completed in a manner that was not fully approved by the O.C.P.I. and the Company's directors."
Last week, former office chief Narcisa King and other former or former OCPI employees were sent to jail in the case, with the charges being decontaminated for services to the firms mentioned, although work was not done.
Pre judicious spending exceeds $250,000.
Aventures in the golden age
In the view of FRH president John Dedman, England can host a major handballing competition only in 2024, and training the women's team for the Olympics costs a fortune.
U.S. basketball coach John Kerry said yesterday during a meeting with reporters that it's a great pride that the country has three teams in the World Series.
In terms of the U.S. women's basketball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Beijing Olympics, but for that they need to go through two more furthest games, in part the World Cup and in the second round the pretournament," Dedman said.
"We're really looking forward to qualifying for the Olympics."
There are some fantastical requirements from the coaching staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Stairs that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a assistant coach, a doctor, two masseuses, a defensive coordinator, a head coach.
They asked us for getting the qualification some things, rather than materials for physical training, of which we never heard.
Astea's all to get the Olimpice. and I will do everything it takes to have them. "
"We're talking about a massive investment, there are lots, lots of money.
But that is the way to make the playoffs.
For the time being we're in the golden age with preparation.
"The teams with whom we're competing have these materials and they have been working for some time," Dedman said, who noted he was trying to get the funds needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The FRH president also referred to the infrastructure in Scotland and the possibility that the country will host a major basketball competition.
We don't have the room at New York.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is unacceptable to be put under a World Cup of gimnastica.
Let's not forget that in other corners of the world they built Olympic neighborhoods entirely in a couple of years' time.
Before 1992, the current Olympic zone in Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it has become a beauty reper.
Just as was in London, where the 2012 Olympics was a success again.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedman said.
He added that international basketball bodies were willing to give England the opportunity to host a major tournament.
For me it's a priority to bring major basketball competitions to the United States. "
"Mr Grange was going civilizat with a project, people gave their backing in principle but they were very quickly settled that there would never be a room.
And I have had discussions with EHF, we've told them we want, that we are capable of organizing and they said they are right and invite them to the first game in the new New York arena and after that we're talking concret.
"So we have all the deschiderea, and the EHF and the IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The former big handler avoided assessing the chances of the women's basketball teams San Antonio and HCM Baia Mare reaching the Final Four: "I have requested all coaches be cautious in their predictions, that if they don't meet they turn against them."

Patchwork of tourist
A family of San Francisco tourists came to Washington to visit him but the trip ended with an amused promise.
"After the experience experienced neither I nor my wife ever want to ever walk in your town.
Without wanting to, they were hit by erroneous information in the posters, the nesimtirea of the RAPT drivers and, bonus, a fine "like the law says."
Soto arrived in Washington in the early hours of the morning, settled in a Centru hotel and asked for tourist posters.
They also got a pliant showing the RATP routes.
"Incomplete" with these maps, the wives visited Washington.
But in the early hours of the morning, in the Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Since there was no tonnage with tickets in the station next door, they were based on the printed information on the pliant: that they can take the ticket by SMS.
"He didn't tell anyone that this service no longer exists."
Incumbent on pliants, they climbed into a bus and tried to send SMS by instructions on the pliant.
Because of them, he made his way to a team of RATP controllers.

"I spoke to the controllers, explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's not their job.

Ghinion for the violin violators.
They had accident and stayed in custody.
The seven sex offenders' trial has moved to the Supreme Court.
Federal jurors heard the first trial in an unsealed hearing in which the seven teenagers accused of raping a 19-year-old girl asked to be put in jail.
Before the actual start of the trial, one of the D.C. judges whose case had been assigned, Mr. Thompson, filed an abbreviation, which was denied by his fellow judges.
The Magistrate served until last summer at the District Court, where he was the president of the On Decision, he was the one who on April 9 admis a challenge by four of the defendants, dispunand their place in the state.
In addition, the case is being heard by a jury of Justice Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier in the case, the court filed an abtinere and Judge Dan An'ton on the grounds that his daughter was in a concubine relationship with one of the offenders' lawyers.
The two judges ordered the sex offenders to remain in custody.
Ti nors will remain jailed for at least another 30 days, when juxtapositions revisit the possibility of putting them in jail.
Urging the trial is expected to be held at the Washington County Courthouse on October 6.
Before reaching the state Supreme Court, the van carrying the violin violin violins was involved in a crash in the Pacific-City neighborhood, the car entering Washington on the centura.
The Iveco truck carrying the seven violins hit a Volks wagen vehicle coming off the Crandall Road, and the driver tried to viper to the right.
Dubs are running from the northern end of Pacurari.
The car went into Washington on Monday because state prison employees favored the route from Virginia to Washington on to Grawduri, then the state's transportation authority.
They eventually cut the road a few miles.
Shortly after the crash, the arest-squad convoy called another transport to take the prisoners.
In short order, the scene was sent a car from the D.C. District Attorney's Office, which took the seven inmates and shipped them to the state Supreme Court.
In the crash, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other dubstep, guards surrounded the back side of the mash-up, and the arrests walked in, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police because drivers of the do ua vehicles have agreed amiably on the damage that needs to be paid," Police Commissioner Madalin Taray said.
Big migrations
America is not and will not be ready for what will follow.
But Europe?
I say from the beginning, clearly and clearly: the no 7000 refugees that America should and should naturalize, in itself, represent a small but huge number in comparison to the federal government's ability to handle such a project.
For the United States, even the voluntary cote proposed by New York, in excess of about 1500 suflete, overlooks our best intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
"With those migrants actually willing to settle in our communities, the chances of integra them quickly into American society are extremely low."
I'm sure they will be the first to lose their patience.
Parazynski's interlopers and pardoned by a vengeful political establishment, the American state is proving impotent in all areas.
Nepalese efforts to integrate the blacks are just a banal example.
Besides, governments of any color were not in a position to abort federal funds, make roads, gradinite or modern schools, provide decent health care, collect the mess on the street, create jobs paid for onorably or keep their own young generatie home.
Why would refugees establish themselves in another country from which they are running away?
But what produces much wonder is indeosebi the flexibility with which such a crisis is treated.
We first hit the below-average fatalism of the powerful EU nations, which give the maximum generousness when it comes to sharing their affairs with smaller countries.
It then comes to the frictive ipocrizia of Americans who, while they have millions of relatives scattered over the world, still nu-l accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Perhaps for fear of stealing any national pride.
At the end of the day, there is also a ipocrizie by many migrants, who, while merely invoca the orthodoxy of war as the reason for the departure, do not accept another destination of the exiles than Germany or the northern countries.
Or, not all refugees are Iraqi, and in Pakistan there's no war.
Also, the simplistic way the crisis is considered can only be taken into deradere.
They must be eliminate the causes, some argue and, strictly focusing on the case for political correctness, are demanding peace and investment for the country's foreign countries.
But in the United States there's peace and even more, out there, some foreign capital into the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Americans from leaving their country each year.
Why leave?
In this crisis, the European Union has been revealed as an anarchic, divided, divided and overwhelmed building.
Deplanging the fact that the UK isn't capable of inventing a country's future, but finally the EU lacks any long-term plan.
And the improvizations and threats do not help.
Then again, to what do the EU really be using, if the only advantage the British enjoy - the right to free movement - could be put in question because of the surge in refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Iraq is going to end.
Not so and the crisis is not over.
Over the next few decades, suprapopulence, poverty, climate change, water shortages etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially Africa, toward a better life.
With such politicians, America is not and will ever be ready for what will follow.

NEW YORK (AP) - A meeting breaks your heart.
At 20 she got a brave gift: parents biologically
losing her hospital in unclear circumstances in the negatives of the 1970s, on when she was only two months old, tiny and unajutored, and then adopted by an instarita family in Italy, the same years when adoption was vexed, a young woman, now a blonda and beautiful girl, reappeared already-in Washington with bipolar parents from a state village after nearly two decades in which nobody knew anything of the others.
Crane will turn 20 this week, and her adopted Palermo parents have been considering offering their loved daughter an uluitor and brave gift: a visit to the United States at Washington to know her neck-and-neck past.
The Washington Post, which witnessed the search for the family's home after several highly vagacious clues, was a witness to these meetings that basically break your heart.
Releasing reporters, the emotions of the moment, the comments of those involved, their reactions are one-sided and overwhelming.
Crane's story begins 20 years ago in the northern Washington suburb of Rugdon on when he was just two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital at the city.
Home there began to be disputes between parents, and the mother was forced to parlay her home.
He decided to keep the girl, and on me to send me off.
He stopped the girl, and since then I've never known anything.
"When I learned I was in hospital, it was too late," remembers devastated Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crane was treated with her grandmother at the county municipal hospital, and all along the girl's father, Costica Balco, drove to work in the state of Alexandria, Va.
Their lives had to finally split apart.
They haven't found Crane at the hospital
After the stay, Crane's father left for work in another town, and returned after six months.
Between them, the girl was transferred to the Washington hospital, and the father, when she returned, never found her.
"I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in hospital.
"She'd thought she was abandoned," a family friend recalls.
Because of financial problems, the grandmother couldn't come with Crane to Washington, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because nobody else was interested in the child's fate throughout the process, she was taken over by the D.C. Children's Health and Family Services Administration, which then gave it for adoption to the Bucium Children's Hospital.
There were years when adoption and adoption were more comfortably regulated compared to today's America.
At the Bucium Centre she was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a Palermo couple who wanted to have their child but couldn't.
They got married on the spot to blondina Crane, and after some time she had to move permanently with them in Italy.
The baby had already spent nearly two years, as long as adoption formalities took.
When I saw Crane, I felt like she was our face.
"As if my wife had given him his life," says smiling Salvadore, his adoptive father, as he catches in his face the firsthand arm of the girl.
In the country, Crane's parents, Alina and Costica, continued their search separately, each on their own.
The father asked Rugland County authorities but got no answer where his child might be.
Police then told her she's possibly dead but in Washington the parents learned what happened to their girl.
When I looked at her here, they told the Tribunal she was gone to Italy at Palermo.
And conditions to look at it never had.
We pray to God to be well. "
I thought about it all the years that passed, but there were no possibilities as a way to run, find it.
"It is hard," she tells us with tears in her biological mother Crane.
But even though the years passed, Ruggerton's parents were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she was from and that her past ties her to the United States.
I was a little girl when I found out.
"I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a kid, I was curious.
"I wanted to know my parents in the UK," Crane admits incantata.
And her dream was to become reality.
In March of this year, Lt. Col. Romo Ichim, the director of the Regional Prevent, Evaluare and Consilier Services of the Washington Police Department, was contacted by a friend in Italy, who explained Salvadore's desire to find Crane's biological family.
And the search started only by name.
"Following the request we have received from our partners in Italy, we began initial efforts.
Priest only gave one name, Balco Costica, then the town, Ruginoasa.
Just before the game we had an activity with the council there, and we could ask if there was by the town the name got the name.
Then they gave me several instructions, only that the person found wasn't also the cautat one.
"It took me until about a month to find the biological father of the girl," police Lt. Romo Ichim explains.
In all, more than three months it took authorities to find Costica and Ms. Smith, especially since each had domiciliul in another town.
We started the demersurile sometime in March, and in the weeks of July and July we completed the identification of bipolar parents and discussions.
"Then we set aside for September to have a first meeting," added Romo Ives.
In the weekend that passed, Ms. Smith and Mr. Costica saw their daughter for the first time lost on the hospital's front page in the early '90s.
The father, emotionat, could barely contain his tears, and his hands trembled uncontrollably.
Just exchange a few words with the jur.
A week before the meeting no one really could sleep.
"He was all emotionat, trembling.
"As a child you see your child after so many years, it is something," a granddaughter tells us, also coming with Costica from Ruginoasa.
Crane's meeting with mother and biological brother
In conversations with his girl, who is to study at a well-regarded university in Italy, Mr. Balfour told him, among other things, that if he ever wanted to return to him, in the village, come quiet: He can give him some sheep, captors, as well as find a boy from the village and incur a household.
My mother's also emotional, crying, and thinks with a lot of thought that such a thing can happen to her.
I'm very emotional.
"I haven't thought it could happen like this.
I've seen such cases on television, I've been thinking about it all these years, I hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that again.
"There are very high emotions.
If they could forgive me.
I hope we can visit in the future. "
"I hope we can keep a connection," she tells us with large tears on her obsides, Crane's mother, as she holds up tightly in a serviceable.
In it she still hides tears, of relief, because in short she will be back with her face after so amar of time.
On the other hand, Crane, who will turn out over just a few days this month, is trying to calm down like a emotive child.
He doesn't know what to expect, but he has schmaltz a vindictive idea about her bipolar parents.
Create they're young, but now before the meeting they try to gather their thoughts, because he really has to say, but nothing to reprosat.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are right now the ones who raised me.
It will be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a nice memories of them because now there are so many things to say," Crane marturiseste.
First family meeting in Washington
In the East Village under the clear autumn sky, the Ruginoasa family united their destinul with their Palermo girl.
Crane is 20 now, finishing college, following the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Ms. and Costica, her bipolar parents.
They never divide them borders or countries, but just a barrier: the language of language.
Over which, with a translator, an Italian local owner in downtown Washington, they passed with ease.
Those who were able to make this meeting say it is the first event of its kind done, and that in the future, if the opportunity is ever ived, they will still do it.
It is the first event of its kind, of such emotional significance, and I'm glad it's a success. "
We, at the Centru, have different activities, and often we are associated as an agency that deals mostly with consumer-heavy people, dependent on drugs.
But we're trying to redress society some good back. "
"If I ever be asked for such an events influencer, I will do it with great regard," says smiling Romo Ichim, the director of the Regional Center for Prevent, Evaluare and Consilier Judetene Washington.
Behind him, the Balco family, with Crane in the middle, indeparteaza telling stories.
They're right: They have lots to tell each other.
Arrest with guns at his foot yesterday at Labour.
Everyone else is drawing their breath.
Tablears in the state's Republican Party have ended a cease-fire with a gun to the hip.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being even tense, Republican leaders fell short of temporarily suspenseful the talks.
Pressed by party executive chairman John McCain to present a united stand, Virginia Republicans will send him a full list of potential candidates for the party's presidential nomination.
Depending on the political outcome, the internal race in the party appears to have only taken a break to allow the combatants to draw their breath.
McCain did not give an ultimatum.
"He's issued a very simple and very current message in the circumstances now: try to find a way to prevent the party from putting itself in trouble."
On October 3 we have elections in the party.
All the jobs will be put to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.
The two days of weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing certain had been determined.
At the October elections, for the party's national leadership there is expected fierce competition.
On the short list of potential candidates for the party's main post are Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, state Rep. John Crocker and state Senate Speaker Vicente M. Fox.
La them may be the mayor of Schitu Duca, Michael Mihalache.
A option being considered is the bid of state Senate Republican leader John Warner should Lupu not run for re-election, with party officials saying he was not interested in the seat.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former state party leader, Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
The list of candidates is open.
Under the statutului, including the day of the election can be submitted candidatura, and it would not surprise anyone if it happened.
"The key is that we remain united, and we will stay again after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Committee, a new Executive Committee and all new leadership structures," Crocker said.
Until the state's primary, the state's leadership will be provided by Vicente M. Fox, a close friend of Edwards and Stanciu.
Lupu is also on leave until Sept. 29, with the preparation of the primary essentially asigurata by the state's executive secretary, state Rep. Mihail Popescu, in close relations with the Nichita camp.
Speaking telefonic, Mr Johnson praised the talks in recent days as leading to "a partial consensus."
"There is a broad willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
There was a partial consensus, in the form of supporting a unelected team to deal with the state.
"But on the other hand, there are more options on the intentions about the Democratic presidential nomination, with the field remaining open," he commented.
D.C. judge rejects sex offenders case on concubine charges
The seven Northern Virginia teenagers convicted of rape arrive today at the U.S. District Court in Washington.
vasluians sentenced to sentences of between five years and eight months and eight months and four months will present their arguments tomorrow on their release after the state's high court set their imprisonment shortly after the verdict.
The case was registered with the High Court at the weekend, with Judge John O'Connor making a request for abbreviation, denied by his colleagues.
Anton cited the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, attorney John Luca, is his daughter's concubine, the lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca represents Mr McBurland, the man who received the biggest sentence in the case.
How did the jury motivat their verdict?
At the end of last week, the state judge who sentenced the seven teenagers to death ped up the verdict.
In the statement the judge talks of the accused's reaction but also those who supported them, saying such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among the public.
"The court finds that after the time of the detention of the accused, the restrictive but not privately-held sentence, under the impact of the defendants' actions, families and local supporters of their, there was to the local and national community a strong sense of outrage with respect to the fact that individuals accused of serious crimes are being tried under a less restrictive order," the court said.
Also on Wednesday, the jury demonized the seven defendants who on the trial cited the fact that the girl they raped may not be the "front door."
"The court emphasizes that it is lipsita of any relevance to the person's moral quality, an aspect the defendants sought to highlight by the arguments they made, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," the order states.
Corbyn, Brexiters and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past zeci years cannot continue at all in the coming years.
Until Saturday probably little people knew in the UK who Mr Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became Britain's new leader, many wonder in Britain's ruling Labouring party can affect us the selection of a politician who, at the very least, is not in a position of decision making.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical conservative leader of the labourers since the war.
Marxist, anti-monarhist (he asked at one point Tony Blair, then first minister, to pull the royal family out of Buckingam Palace), an anti-American fervent and a supporter of Mr Putin (he was reportedly invited to comment on political events by the BBC's "Russia Today" channel), and the terrorist movements HizHezbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to abandon nuclear weapons and run out of NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered Osama bin Laden's killing a real tragedy, ISIS is almost likely to be the United States' favorite.
Following the model of all the populists, Corbyn, presumably, has miraculous anti-austeritate solutions.
Lucrative things like those he was saying and promising to Tsipras in Greece until he gave up the real world and economic legacies.
The new labour-run leader's programme, among other things, includes massive renationalisation and printing money as a solution for funding development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Sure, some may wonder why the solution with printing money is not unanimously adopted across the globe, we would then have a general worldwide prosperity!, but who can ever prevent such details from being passed on?
Sure, we can tax the bankers, becoming a kind of serving enemies of the left, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in former communist states or Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France at the start of Mitterand and Sarkozy's governments.
Additional amounts are quickly eaten away by generous, without acoperire promises made by populace demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher well warned, "the socialism problem is that at some point the money is over to others."
Few give Mr Corbyn any real hope of ever becoming prime minister.
At the start of the 1980s another radical conservative leader, Michael Foot, who unfortunately wasn't as extreme in beliefs as the proaspatul party leader, lamentably failed in the election.
And then there is still Britain's working class, in the classic sense of the word, relatively substantial and structured.
And unions were sensibil more influential than now.
As the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant in the work force, and extensive automation has made it hard for industry to rely heavily on highly skilled hand labor, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In his last Financial Times magazine he believes that Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexitering, or iesirea from the EU.
The new labour-run leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promotor of globalization that imposed austerity-poor austeritate.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by radical left, anti-immigration rhetoric and you look at the crisis that zguduie the EU you get a explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the Britons decide in the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the bloc's symbolic loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep falsehood created within it by the Euro crisis and now of the war between the North and South between the East and West, leaves room for scenarios out of the blue.
With so much more to come for a whole host of member nations, London was a contraption to the franco-German axa (in which since London unfortunately becomes the dominant player).
It's true, the British business community, the City-owned, are strong lawyers for staying the country in the EU.
But today Europe is no longer the one of the past.
There are many resurgent resurgent teams, which are growing in intensity even these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I've actually had a mould recently in Jean Clude Junker's speech, increasingly tends to take major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of member states consulting with only a few European powers, primarily with Germany.
And that is as electoral support for antiwar, anti-immigration parties that are in the same breath also eurosceptics is rising dramatically across the continent.
With the emotional climate, the emotional climate with negative incarcatura has reached higher levels than ever in the past.
From which the Financial Times makes its point when assessing the Brexiters' chances.
The pro-EU Option is based on a cold calculation that starts from national interest.
If voters take the cerebral approach, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of fear in the current politics.
Or, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we are seeing more pronounced integration of the euro zone, which will push most of the region's nations and to the sidelines of interest and that of the decision making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States is alimenteaza his population-based rhetoric from the frustration accumulated in oocidental societatile.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past zeci years, generous social benefits, cannot continue at all in the coming years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dueling, Euro zone - immigration crisis, both caused by prising decisions that have only taken into account integration-related political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of Europe's nations and governments to meet such challenges, the turmoil on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and potentially affect the UK's position.
And it's hard to rule out anything from the point of view of possible scenario.
The question is whether our main political leaders are in a position to make up for such complicated situations.
Mr. Brancusi, the wacky taran.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Take your matura and atelierul!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: be someone, get famous, hear about it all around the world.
Behind his renumele is also something almost forgotten today, when we are delivered millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
That something also has a name.
It's called "trite."
What to write about Mr. Brancusi?
What's more to say, of course?
His face appeared on the notes.
And, since recently, a prominent New York bank has hired an actor to play him in an advertising video.
Brancusi produces and delivers money nearly 60 years after he's never been around.
In the United States, there are hundreds of streets and bulevards bearing his name.
Of course, even the author of this text lives on one of those streets.
And when he walks out on the outside with his children, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, at Brancusi."
The country is immaculate with its statues.
There are few American figures whose works have been known to so many people, from children, to varstnici.
"The ability to infiltrate Brancusi is huge.
Neither the comunistii were able to exhaust him from America's memory and culture.
His clowns imitate the Internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of like-uri and sharpenings.
And then, out of sight, what else would be left to say, about this man?
Looking out at the pile of books and articles trying to rewrite his destinul, Mr. Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally imperfect.
You know, there are those people telling you that if you didn't have the luck of growing up in any big city and in a family as instarita as you are, your chances of success in life are almost nil.
Mr. Brancusi's life is the perfect example.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe from here should the text begin.
With a sentence, however detentioned these are.
Uses the creamy creamy stories, which are delivered daily in newspapers and television.
Look at this man's face.
Want to know how he managed in life, how, today, of him has an entire maverick heard?
It's simple.
He worked all his life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Mr. Brancusi was born Feb. 19, 1876, in Hobson, a small village in the town of Peston, Pa., at the foot of the mountains.
It is Maria and Mr. James's fifth child.
With his family from an instarita farming family, Brancusi was living a modest life, but one of which had to pick up repertory that would guide his tarnished artistic vision.
Amintiti-va to his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist had to admit in a meeting with Mr. Tutt in Paris from 1933: "On then life was beautiful and ordoning."
For million-year-old years, people were living, happy, a patriarhal life.
It was going quietly from one anotimp to another.
And you know why things have changed?
Civilization of the great city has come to a close.
Brancusi's copilot was also far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is highly reprezentative for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor's years spent in his native town.
The moment is retold in the "Brancusi's A biography," written by Mr. Buick.
In 1879, Mr. Brancusi was 3.
In the fall of that year, when the tuica was being made "at the cazel," watching those who were drinking the lichid as a way to see if the process was going on, Brancusi was catching a moment of general unease.
He fills his cairn with tuica and drinks on the nerasufline.
Cade into sleep almost instantly.
The first people only notice after a few minutes.
The mother goes into the panic, then into the isteria, believing her son had died.
By night, when the father, Mr. Smith, turns from the grave accompanied by lautaries, sees from the departare the desperate signs of those waiting with their eyes.
The party soon turns into jams.
The father is already considering buried him.
Still, someone finds it good to call her Baba Brandy, the doting and serviceable Brancans.
Brandy checks the child's breathing, then puts under his horse bison, gathered from the surrounding house.
The child stranut strongly.
The crowd cheered.
While the boy's left to sleep back his beaming, happy party, the party with lautaries continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the livelihoods.
Mr. Brancusi puts Mr. Jackson to collect some nukes and bring them.
The father puts his child's head down and, with the nuances brought by the boy, beat him as well.
And while feeling the usturimea of the blow, little Brancusi has the revelry that the world can also be viewed from a different perspective and that things around can emerge rasturnated.
Especially the sun's position, different from the familiar, makes him wonder, as he had to admit at his retirement, whether not even the moon himself was participating in his tulburation.
Should the sun have been as troubled as his father was by what had been happening?
At the moment, the city is not working.
An MP makes it clear to politicians to bring their hands on those who voted for them.
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa made it clear that Republicans and Democrats would end their internal battles and redirect their agenda to the electorate.
What we are seeing now on our political stage is a great divizioning and so on.
"We have seen nothing from the Democratic 2012 plans that will continue.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Spire, you just see politicians disputa their possible location based on their real estate interests.
Let's let a bit of politics go, get together and talk.
At the moment, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with the domestic war, you just don't have time for the people who elected you," said Blanco.
He praised the current class of voters, the result going to be a very reduced turnout at future general elections around the 30% mark, essentially representing the loyal party base.
Also, the congressman believes voters will turn all over traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Washington" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very low hopes and will do little to break the left of the left's voters, not the Labour Party.
Such parties rely on active civic voters, who usually are conservative.
"It farce further, which is not good for anybody, either," Blanco said.
He said he was not interested in a run for the coming general election, dispel rumors of his intention to run for mayor.
