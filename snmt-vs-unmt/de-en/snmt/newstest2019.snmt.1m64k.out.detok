Walisian Agerolons took care of "like Dödel"
There is consternation among some members of the Assembly about a proposal to change its title on MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this was plans to change the name of the National Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of all the parties to the National Assembly are concerned that they might be exposed to this.
A Labour MEP said that his group 'joins Twp and Pwp'.
Note for the reader: "twip" in the Welsh means "propelling" and "pwp" means "kaze".
A meeting member of Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole is "not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group would be “open ” to a name change, but pointed out that it is only a brief verbal leap to“ Muppet ” from “MWP ” (member of the Welsh Parliament).
Note: The Welsh letter W is similar to the U in English.
The Commission of the National Assembly, which is currently working on a draft legislation on the name changes, said: ‘ The final decision on the name of the members of the National Assembly is naturally up to the Members themselves. ’
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Welsh Parliament was given the opportunity to change its name.
In June last year, the Commission published the results of a public hearing on the proposals according to which there is broad agreement on the name change in the Welsh Parliament.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On the question of the title of the meeting members, the Commission preferred Welsh Members or WMPs, but the VAT option received most support in a public consultation.
Members of the Welsh Parliament apparently propose alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus may cause headaches for Chairman Elin JONES, who is expected to present a bill for these changes in the coming weeks.
Legislation on reforms will involve changes in the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of Members of the Welsh Parliament and the establishment of the screening system.
Members of the National Assembly can decide how to call them in the debate on the law.
Macedonians are holding a referendum on the change of the name.
On Sunday, the voters will vote on the amendment of the country ’ s name to ‘ Republic of North Macedonia ’.
The referendum will be held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly appealed against its application for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are ringing, as churches in Harlem have problems.
'Historically, the old people with whom I spoke said that there was a bar and a church in every corner ', Mr Adams said.
"Today there is neither."
He said that the disappearance of pubs is understandable.
"People make cometacts in a different way", today he said.
"Locations are no longer a living room in the neighborhood where you meet regularly".
As far as churches are concerned, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect.
Churches could be replaced by multi-family houses with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries of the area.
The overwhelming majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will know, he said, "and will therefore speed up the day when these churches are closed completely, because it is unlikely that most of those people who make up on these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem 1870 became the black metropolis – Metropolitan Community, St. Martin ’ s a decade later.
The original white methodological community departed in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was acquired by a black community that had a religion nearby.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in the 125 Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who opposed the recruitment or promotion of black.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but when the community members of Father Johnson made plans for reconstruction, they entrusted the bell game.
Priest David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the Bell Game "the Bell of the Poor."
The expert who played the bell game in July called it another: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first game of the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, switched to the bigger glockensgame on the Riverside Church.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace it.
What has happened in the last few months at St. Martin was a complicated history of architects and builders, some were brought by Church leaders, others by the bishop's diocese.
The sacristy – the parish ’ s governing body, made up of secular leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with the concern that the Diocese "would try to hand over the costs to the sacristy", although the sacristy was not involved in the commissioning of the architects and contractors of the diocese.
Some community members complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Hai was 13 years old when he was humming in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, while on the opening day of the Hummerseason he fell to lobsters, said officials.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Ennitas.
Chad Hammel said KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had flown up with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy cry for help, and then went over with the others to save him from the water.
“First I thought someone was pleased because he caught a lobster, ” said Hammel, but then I noticed that someone shouted:“ I was bitten! ”
I was bitten!
His entire key leg was raised, Hammel said, he found it when he came to the boy.
I shouted to make them out of the water: "There is a shark in the water!" said Hammerel.
The boy was brought to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was critically documented.
The species responsible for the attack is unknown.
A media briefing Captain Larry Giles said that a shark had been seen in the area several weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added traumatic injury to the upper body of his victim.
Officials closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecnitas for 48 hours for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury is planning to take over the British beauty market.
Sainsbury's takes care of boat, superdrug and Debenham with shelves with beauty products in the Kaufhaus style, which are occupied with professional assistants.
As part of an extensive push in the UK beauty market, which is growing further and worth <unk> 2.8bn, fashion and homeware sales will fall.
The idea of investing in the beauty market has resulted in supermarkets looking for ways to use the shelf used for television, microwave and household items for new products.
Sainsbury informed us that the range of beauty products will be doubled to 3000 products by including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing assortment of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space in brand areas, similar to those found in shops like boats.
The supermarket chain also revives its own brand of “Boutique ”, which has many trusted trusted trusted products with young buyers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop is testing concessions in two sainburys shops, of which the first week was opened in Croydon, South London, while a second end of this year is opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and a shift to daily purchases of small quantities of food in neighborhood stores mean that supermarkets have to do more to get people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief of Sainsbury ’ s, said that the stores will increasingly look like stores, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight discount like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.
Sainbury's has placed Argos Outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which allegedly strengthened food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to review its cosmetics and pharmacological departments ended with a failure.
Sainbury has tested a joint venture with boat in the early 2000s, but it ended unetchieden, and revenues from pharmacies could not be shared.
The new strategy comes after Sainbury's sales of its 281-Filialen-Pharmacy business three years ago for GBP 125 million on Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds will also be involved in four Lloyds Stores to extend the range of luxury skin care products of brands such as La Roche-Posada and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the advertising director of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance of our shelves for cosmetic products to improve the equipment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in training staff to assist the customer with advice.
The elegant ambience, the affordable inner city location and a revolutionary shopping experience make us a popular destination in beauty matters.
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby had cut off the $11 million deal.
Dragons The Star Peter Jones went "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby of <unk> 11 million Vetrag goes out with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for her Homewear- and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning presenter announced on Instagram that she will go.
Holly Willoughby made Dragons' Den-Star Peter Jones angry because at the last minute she had withdrawn from her common lucrative lifestyle brand in order to focus on her new flagship contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was furious when, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the head of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that their new shops, worth up to GBP 1.5 million, meant that she had not had enough time to devote to her Homewear- and Accessice-Truly brand.
The business was compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow, and it was estimated that Willoughoff ’ s assets would double <unk> 11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she would leave True, Jones Britain and flew to one of his holiday homes.
A source said, "It was really high on Holly's list of priorities."
It should be its long-term future and secure it for the coming decades.
Their decision to withdraw was totally covert.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday – just before the start.
"At Marlow HQ there is a warehouse full of goods that can be sold."
Experts believe that the passage of the "This Morning" Moderator, which is one of the most bankrupt stars in Britain, could cost the company millions because it invested heavily in products such as cushions, candles, clothing and homewear, and the potential for further delays in the market launch.
And it may mean the end of a long friendship.
For ten years, Willoughby and his man, Dan Baldwin, Jones, and his wife Tara Capp have been close by.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples make their holidays together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin ’ s TV production company.,, is.
Willoughby is said to be a trademark ambassador for M & S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source of information in the surroundings of Jones said yesterday evening: 'We would not speak about our business.'
Tough Talk, and then we fell in love.
He talked about criticism that he would receive from the news media because he had made a comment that some would consider to be 'unprivileged' and because he gave the North Korean leader such a positive opinion.
Why has President Trump made so many compromises?
This was what Trump said in his “spokesperson for the news. ”
“I have not made any compromises. ”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed her first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have been blocked.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea ’ s leading diplomat, said to the leaders of the United Nations on Saturday that the North does not see a "" response from the US to North early disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the US continues sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his manifesto.
“We are making good progress with North Korea, ” he said.
“We wanted to wage war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship. ”
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results, such as ending missile tests, releasing hostages, and returning the remains of American soldiers back home.
And he defended his unusual behavior when he spoke about relations with Kim.
"It is so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out who try to come to this fully packed arena, roughly 200 people would stand there," said Trump and showed the crowd directly before him.
In Indonesia, a tsunami and an earthquake kill hundreds and devastated an island.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population was relocated to Lombok, no national disaster was declared, a condition for the catalyzing of international aid.
Summon said: 'Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not request international aid so that it is a small challenge',
While Save the Children brings together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not sure whether foreign personnel can work locally.
The speaker from the National Civil Protection Agency, Mr Sutopo, said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu in order to see whether international organisations can contribute to the aid measures.
Unfortunately, the country is not well prepared for the forces of nature in the face of the earthquakes that are constantly causing Indonesia.
While the tsunamis were built in Aceh, what is not common for other coastal lines.
The obvious absence of a tsunami warning suicide in Palu, though a warning has already been in force, is likely to have contributed to the loss of human life.
Even under favourable conditions, travel between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
An Lazarette ship deployed to treat the earthquake victims in Lombok is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia ’ s broken infrastructure a core part of his campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But financing deficits plagued Mr Josos ’ s government, even though he faces re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from continuing religious tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs had street battles with machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.

The Cromwell Parliament statue will be the latest landmark success in the history series.
His exile would be poetic justice to his talian-like destruction of so many of England ’ s cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritans.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Mr. Crick ’ s proposal as “folly ” and as a“ attempt to rewrite history. ”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In view of the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted before the Westminster Palace. ”
The episode of the German Civil War was neither performed by Cromwell nor performed.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed to the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thornnycroft ’ s great representation of Cromwell bears witness to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and that Cromwell is still dominant in parts of history: that Cromwell is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to the ‘ Sunday Telegraph ’: ‘ Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is an absolutely correct representation is the subject of the continuing historical debate.
To be sure, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that stands for one side of the gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth remembering and celebrating. ”
Killing the China ’ s Broken Farmers
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
He was a man who was identified as the 'Yuxan', and his Arterie was riding through blood and was buried dead, near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.

You are like small children, very curious... they want to do a not hurt.

Hurricane Rosas ’ s Extractive Tropical Tropical
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening while heading toward the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Yet, over the next few days, Rosa will provide exuberant rain over the north of Mexico and the southwest of the US.
Rosa was at 5 a.m. wind speeds of 137 kmh, a hurricane in Category 1, and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
She is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific has begun to form a trog and move east towards west coast of the United States.
Rosa will rain up to 10 cm in parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will interact with the nearest low over the coming days, causing widespread heavy rain in the southwest.
Local flooding, rubble flows and possible landslides in the desert will cause 2.5 to 10 cm of rain.
High humidity is caused by precipitation rates of 5 to 8 millimetres per hour, especially in the south of Nevadas and parts of Arizonas.
Around 5 to 10 cm rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over large parts of Arizona.
The dense nature of the tropical forest makes it possible to quickly flood the flood situation.
It is strongly discouraged to make hiking trips to the desert, as there is a risk of tropical rain.
Starker rainfall could lead to gorges becoming raging rivers and thunderstorms that could bring local winds and thunderstorms.
The approaching low will produce a number of locally heavy rains for parts of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall of more than 1.3 cm is possible, which could lead to slight rock-bottom and smooth roads.
This is the first rainfall in the region that starts the wet season.
Some covered tropical rain showers will approach late Sunday and early Monday in Arizona before the rain spreads on late Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread from Tuesday to Wednesday to all sides.
In October, there may be major temperature fluctuations in the entire US, as the Arctic is cooling and remains fairly warm in the tropics.
This may lead to large temperature differences over short distances.
There is a great example of dramatic temperature differences by the central USA. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is almost a 20-degree temperature difference.
In the next few days, summer heat will try to rebuild and expand.
Most of the central and eastern USA is expected to see a warm start in October with a diversified 26 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high opportunities for the East average temperatures in the U.S. in the first half of the month of October.
More than 20 million people have been following the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people saw on Thursday in six television channels the compelling statement by the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
During this time, the political situation was not changing in sight, television channels interrupted their regular program on Friday due to an unexpected last-minute twist: an agreement drafted by Jeff Flake from the Arizona Senate that the FBI should carry out a weekly investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to dress her clothes after a high-school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate statement, said that he was 100% sure that the allegations were wrong.
Niels reported that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people probably looked at it.
The company counted the average audience figures at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For the other networks that the hearing showed, there were no figures, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some problems to capture people who are watching in offices.
To compare this, it is a similar number of spectators, such as a playoff football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all networks with an average number of 5.69 million viewers during the full consultation.
With 3.26 million, ABC had the second most viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the mid-Republicaner office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was intercepted by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, seeing him screamed by the Protestants while trying to enter a lift to a court hearing.
He had a look at him for several minutes while he was attacked, all of which was transmitted live to CNN.
“I stand in front of you ”, a woman said.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
He was told, ‘ You have power while many women are powerless. ’
Flake said that his office issued a statement and before the access doors closed that he had more to say in the county hearing.
The cable and radio networks later broadcast live when the Committee on Justice was supposed to vote to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh as the full Senate.
But Flake said that he would only do so if next week ’ s FBI were to examine the accusations against the nominee, which many Democrats who are in the minority have been demanding for some time.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and various Senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flakes ’ election had power, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the FBI against accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for “political games. ”
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political games ” with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will be appearing at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, alongside the newspaper ’ s front page with her, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should absorb the tariffs of the other is “completely absurd. ”

Rambled embers over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would approach the volcano after activity in the crater and 6.3 gas and ash eruptions has been registered in the last 24 hours.
The centre monitored several tremors.
Pictures in the social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in Mexico City, for example in Xanochkonco.
Geophysicists have registered an increased activity in the volcano, which is located 72 km (45 miles) south of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 in September 2017 shook the center of Mexico.

The police provided confrontations with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence
On Saturday, during the first anniversary of the referendum on independence in Catalonia, there were clashes between demonstrators for independence with the armed police.
A group of masked pro-separatists held hostage by the riot police brought them to eggs and ignited powder paint and produced dark clouds in the streets that were usually crowded by tourists.
In the course of the day, they also broke out with the police, armed with bullets to stop the unrest.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “No Forget, no forgiveness, ” to them trade union protests that“ Lang live Spain. ”
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor violations that they had committed during the protests, the local press reported.
There is still tension following the referendum of 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid, yet it is celebrated by separatist Catalan.
The electorate overwhelmingly decided to vote independently, even though there were only a few voters who voted for secession.
According to the Catalan authorities, there were 1 000 people injured last year when the police tried to stop the referendum and there were violent clashes in various polling stations in the region.
Activist groups for independence had stayed outdoors on Friday to prevent a demonstration of the supporters of the national police.
The demonstration went on but was forced to go down a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he lost hope of the prospect of Catalonia ’ s independence.
"Last year we saw one of our best moments.
"I have seen how my parents are happy to cry because we can vote, but now we are stuck firmly," he said.
Although the Catalan independence parties have won a decisive, albeit marginal, victory in the regional elections last December, they have been struggling this year to remain in detention with many of their most famous leaders either in exile or in detention, who are waiting for their role in organising the referendum and the process for a later declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a forty-year-old mechanic who drew up the protest to help the police on his mobile phone, said that the conflict was stirred up by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming ever more tense, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in the investigation prison since the end of last year, announced that he will run next year in the European Parliament elections.
“Running for the European elections is the best way to stand up against the loss of democratic values and the decline of the Spanish Government, ” he said.

Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was repeatedly collected in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballyngard Crescent on Thursday at about 19: 30 British summer time.
Crime inspector Bob Blemmungen said that both the gate and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, a crossbow was probably shot on the car.
Menga-Shot spells Livingston to 1: 0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas ’ s first gate for Livingston has secured victory.
Livingston stunned the Rangers and brought Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga ’ s hit was crucial to Gary Holts ’ team ’ s second place to Hibernian.
Gerrard ’ s team could not yet have won an out-victory in the Premiership this season and hit the table leader Hearts next Sunday, who is ahead of 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers Rapid Vienna had a guest in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his unplanned course in the division to six games, with Chief coach Holt still had to taste a defeat since he had replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livington offers opportunities for uncentered opponents
Holts had to go to lead long ago because they caused major problems for the Rangers with their direct game.
Scott Robinson broke out with the ball, but pulled his attempt over the gate, then Alan Lithgov could only pass his efforts after he had transported Craig Halketts Headball over the gate.
The hosts agreed to let the Rangers play ahead, knowing that they could disrupt visitors in standard situations.
And that was the way in which the crucial gate came.
The Rangers had a freecrash and Livington opened up by combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson with Menga, who was caught in the penalty room by playing a hand.
At that time, the ball was in the court for most of the time, but the host ’ s impenetrable defense prevented Torkeeper Liam Kelly from participating.
This pattern continued to the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a balloon response from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was repelled from the feet of the Ranrow, Allan McGregor, and Lithgov was given an extension because of a different Livingston Standdardsst.
There were constant clashes in the penalty room of Livingston and continued to settle, while the demand for two strikers - after Halkett was killed by the replacement player Glenn Middleton foulte and one because of handball.
Livingston ’ s Obstacles – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from Scotland BBC in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A great achievement and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
All together they were excellent, and they were still exceeded expectations in this upward trend.
Their style of play and staff have changed very little since their return to the top league, but Holt is a great tribute to the way in which he has spurred the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett provided an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worral kept on trail all the time.
But the Rangers lacked ideas.
As good as they were sometimes under Gerrard, they fell far short of these standards.
Their last ball left to be desired – just once they have cut the home team openly – and it is something like a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle table.
Emulate mood at the reception of Erdo<unk>an in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) there was a good mood in good weather when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - the aim is to restore relations between NATO allies.
There was disagreement on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then set up for Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police gave security reasons why they stopped a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many followers came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<unk>an protesters – many of them Kurds – also made themselves heard and condemned both Erdo<unk>an ’ s policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflect the split of a visitor, celebrated by some German Turks as a hero and beaten by others as an autocrat.

In October last year, the riot police was set up to control a situation in which staff with pool balls were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa threatens phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (Dürregeberiete can benefit)
Arizona is a tropical low-pressure area, but that is what is likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosas ’ s last hurricane hit the desert in the southwest, bringing potential flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash light measuring devices for Monday and Tuesday for the Western Arizona in the South and East Nevadas, in the south-east of California and Utahs, including the cities of Phoenix, flagship hotel, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is likely to ride across Phoenix directly on Tuesday and bring rain on late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a Tweet that only ten tropical hurricanes since 1950 have maintained the tropical storm or cyclone status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the AZ-border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches, with an isolated range of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other desert Southwest areas, including central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to get 2.5 to 5 cm, with isolated amounts up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of flash floods, the rain that Rosa brings with it can be a blessing, because the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of these rainfall will probably be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, the second highest category, "reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa ’ s path leads to a landing over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, had the power of a hurricane with maximum wind speeds of 136 km / h on Sunday morning, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves to the north at a speed of 19 km / h.
The storm hits the Pacific Ocean in cooling waters and is therefore watered down.
This is why Rosa will meet on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall in parts of Mexico could be strong and pose considerable risk of flooding.
Total sums are expected from 7 to 15 cm of Baja California in the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm, ” reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will take place until late in the night for Tuesday through Arizona and southern Utahs.
“The greatest danger expected by Rosa or its consequences is very heavy rains in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonoras and in the USA. Desert, said National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rain will cause life-threatening flash floods and Murades to desert and mudslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests to attempt murder
Three teenagers and one 20-year-old were arrested for the suspicion of trying to murder after a 16-year-old man was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found on Saturday at 04: 00 BST in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton.
He was brought to hospital that his condition remains “stable. ”
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area overnight, said Avon and the police of Somerset.
Officers have all challenged possibly cellular footage about what happened.
Trump says, Kavanaugh suffered the common sense, the fury of the Democratic Party.
“If you vote for Judge Kavanaugh, vote against the utterly outrageous tactic of the Democratic Party, ” Trump said at an election event in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered from the Democratic Party ’ s attacks during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh said before the Congress that he was emotionally and forcefully accusing Christine Blasey Ford of having sexually harassed them decades ago when they were young people.
Ford also said at the hearing about the accusation.
The President said on Saturday that “the American people this day witnessed the brilliance and quality and courage of Kavanaugh. ”
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a lethal recording of the public service," he said the mass of fans of West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican electoral turnout in the mid-term elections.
“Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
My campaign has not yet begun, but I feel as though he had already started, ” he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere".
Trump argued that Democrats had the mission “to resist and block. ”
The first important vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, and a senior GOP leader has said CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia ’ s earthquakes, tsunami; death rates are rising.
At least 384 people were killed, many were swept away when huge waves hit the beaches, while a massive earthquake and tsunami shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered together on Friday in the city of Palu at a festival on the beach when six metres high waves hit the coast in the evening, causing many deaths and devastating devastation.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of strength 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people went on to the beach and did not immediately run away and they were the victims, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nuenho, spokesman of the Indonesian Civil Protection Authority BNPB in a state briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami destroyed cars, houses!", said Nubraho, and added that the tsunami can take speeds of 800 km / h (497 mph) before it meets the coastline.
Some people climbed to trees to escape the tsunami, and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and blown bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday there were other aftershocks in the coastal town.
The series of earthquakes was noticeable in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released from Friday ’ s massive quake was about 200 times the power of a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima during World War II.
You said that the city ’ s geography, on a long and narrow bay, could have enhanced the size of the tsunamis.
NuGroho described the damage as “comprehensive ” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels had crashed.
The bodies of some victims were found in the ruins of the buildings that were destroyed, he said and added that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
NuGroho said that the victims and the damages along the coast could be greater 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication routes “were completely damaged without information ” from Donggala, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, ” the Red Cross issued a statement, adding that members of the organization and volunteers are on the way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse, ” said the organization.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized because it did not announce that Pali was captured by a tsunami, even though officials said that the waves had come within the time when the warning was issued.
In amateur recordings that we can see in the media, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building shouting.
Within minutes, a waterfall crashed on the shore that left the buildings and cars in the water.
Reuters could not authenticate the recordings immediately.
The quake and tsunami caused a severe power failure that disrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate bailouts.
The military bagann sent in cargo planes from Jakarta to other cities said the authorities.
The city's airport was only opened for disaster relief and will remain closed until October otherwise.
President Joko Widodo should visit the Sunday evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia is increasing to over 800.
It is very bad.
While the staff of World Vision from Donggala made it safely to the city of Palu, where the employees were set up in the courtyard of their offices, they were witnesses on the way of scenes of destruction, said Doeba.
“They told me they saw many destroyed houses, ” he said.
It is very bad.
Even as aid organisations took their work to get emergency aid started, some people complained that foreign disasterworkers could not travel to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesian rules, financial resources, supplies and overseas personnel can only be provided the disaster becomes a national disaster zone.
That has not happened yet.
“It is still a disaster for the province, ” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"Once the government says:" OK, this is a national disaster, "we can open the way for international aid, but there is no status yet.
When the second night passed on Friday after earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those still missing were hopeful that their loved ones would be the wonders defying the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a small boy was found in the channel.
On Sunday, he freed a woman who for two days died in ruins of her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding Team, had brought in two of the missing Paraglider he trained for Asian games.
Others who were in the Roa Roca Hotel were Mr. Mandgi and his students.
“As an experienced paragliding glider, I ’ m mentally hard to crack on it, ” he said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the hours after the news about the crash of the Roa-Roa Hotel in the paraglider scene, Gendon once again told us that he had sent messages of whistle-blowers to the Palu competitors who took part in the beach festival.
But on his news he received only a grey checkmark instead of two blue.
"I think this means that the messages were not sent," he said.

West: Rapper changes his name to Ye.
Rapp Kanye West changes its name in Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: "Official to be known as the Kanye West."
West, 41, who has been nicknamed Ye for some time, has chosen this name as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
According to the organisers of the show, he is replacing Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance for “emotional reasons ”.
According to West, this is not only an abbreviation of his current profession, he had previously indicated that the word would be of religious importance to him.
“Yes is probably the most frequently used word in the Bible and means You, ” said West earlier this year in an interview with the Big Boy radio station.
"So, I am you, I am us, we are.
Kanye, which means the only, becomes Ye – and is only a reflection of our good, our wicked, our confusion, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are. "
He is one of many famous rappers who change their names.
Sean Combs was known as Pud Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Broher Love.
JAY Z, which used to be working with West, has also resigned with or without hyphen and uppercase letters.
Mexico ’ s President AMLO has vowed not to deploy a military against civilians.
In the course of the close of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students, Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has never sought military violence against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to never use the military to repress the Mexican people.
On 2 October 1968, troops had finished a peaceful demonstration of leftist student groups with weapons, killing the 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has promised to provide financial support to Mexican students on a monthly basis and to open further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of education left young people in the criminal gangs.
The US should double Artificial Intelligence spending
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its research investments, says Kai-Fu, investor, and AI-rakters who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These demands were created after US officials made pronouncements on AI, even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: by 2030, it wants to be number 1 in the AI innovation sector.
“doubled spending on AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries lag far behind the US, and a breakthrough in AI research is about to come, ” said Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of achieving the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the US, said Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI SuperPower: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order (AI superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the new world order) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of the most famous Chinese AI companies, Face +.
In the 1980 ’ s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University on a AI system that defeated the highest ranking American Otlight player, and later served as Head at Microsoft Research and President of Google ’ s Chinese branch.
Lee recognized the US government ’ s previous technological competition, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (US Defense Research Agency), and asked when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries.
“Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to get government grants, ” Lee said.
“Not China is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists, but for companies, ” said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have in recent years hired universities to work on AI.
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts.
“I think Green Cards should be offered automatically PhD students in AI, ” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its next generation artificial intelligence development plan (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan) in July 2017.
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States formed the Ministry of Defence with a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which is to involve industrial and scientific partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DART has announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called “AI Next. ”
As far as the NSF is concerned, it is currently investing more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that wanted to create a national artificial intelligence security commission has been heard for months.
Macedonia is voting in a referendum on whether to change its name.
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether their name should be changed in the 'Republic of Northern Macedonia', a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbour's name imposes a territorial claim on the Greek territory, and has vetoed the country's entry to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavonic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum, and there are doubts as to whether the outcome will create the 50% hurdle, which is a prerequisite for the referendum ’ s validity.
The question on the voting paper was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece?'
Advocates of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth continuing to include institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came to vote today to vote on the future of the country; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means a life of greater security for all of us, ” said Olivera Georgieva, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough Members have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote so that it becomes crucial.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The House Election Committee said at 13 p.m. that there were no reports of irregularities.
But turnout was only 16% – at the last parliamentary election in 2016, the figure was 34% at the same time, and 66% of registered voters ended voting.
“I voted for my children – our place is in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dushko, voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the name of the country which would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and put chairs before the tents set up by those who are boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to take up with heads, not by the door of service," said Kavadarkov.
“We live in a poor country, but we also have our dignity.
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia, we can turn to others such as China and Russia to join us in Euro-Atlantic integration. ”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe that a large majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO, ” declared Zaev after his vote.
According to him, the “yes ” outcome would be a“ affirmation of our future. ”
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research published the results of a survey: between 30 and 43% of voters would thus vote – less than necessary.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents will vote on Sunday.
Of those who want to participate, 70% said that they would vote ‘ yes ’.
The referendum is only adopted if the turnout is more than 50%.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-western government ’ s policy since its inauguration in May last year.
Seit: Sergio Agüero from Manchester City surmounts the entire Brighton-defense on the way to the gate.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling completed Brighton defense at Manchester City-2 victory on Saturday at Etiha Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his hits in the 65th minute incredibly simple.
At the beginning of the game sequence, the Argentinean striker in the middle field received a pass.
He commanded three defenders of Brighton to free-play.
Then Agüero was surrounded by three green themes.
He surrounded a defender before he ran several players on the edge of the Brighton prison.
Then he left a passport and stopped dying.
The English striker used his first contact to return the ball to Agüero, who then shot with right – past Brighton-Torenhyeev Ryan in the right side of the gate.
"Aguero has foot problems," said city manager Pep Guaraniola reporters.

That has happened.
Fortunately, he shot a gate at the moment. ”
However, it was Sterling who first led the Sky blues at the Premier League-Duell:
The Gate came in the 29th minute
In the game Aguero the ball was played deep in the territory of Brighton.
with a beautiful steep pass to Leroy Sané along the left side.

Scherzer wants to play corrupt games against Rockies
Since the player's national player was excluded from the competition, there was not much reason to force another start.
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are Playoff-implications for the Rockies that have a lead from a game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies secured at least one place ahead with a 5-2 victory over the national on Friday evening, but the title win in the first league is still not sure.
"Even if we play for free, we can at least put ourselves in the stuff, because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best we have to offer this year.
Why should I not want to make a difference? '
The national have not yet announced a start for Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, gave an uptrip on Thursday and began his normal day of rest.
The Washington jurist is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2 / 3 Innings this season.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia
The president drew attention to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Everything we have achieved is at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great - I run not, but I really run, so I fight everywhere for great candidates, he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, radical democrat group, you see that it is just now.
And they are determined to regain power with all the necessary means, and do not stop there even from malfeasance and commonalities.
They do not care about who they hurt whom they must pass over to gain power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them.
“The Democrats ’ goal is to oppose and block, ” he said.
"And you see this in the last four days," he said and called the democrats "angry and common, evil and evil".
"He referred specifically to the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, a high-level member of the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs, and thus raised loud Buhruet from the audience.
“Do you remember your answer?
Do you have the document in operation?
No, what.
No, yes, I, moment – that was really bad body language – the worst body language I have ever seen. ”
The Labour Party is no longer a wide community.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When momentum activists in my local party voted to criticise me, it was hardly a surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Labour MEPs who say that we are not welcome, only because we have said our opinion.
My group colleague Joan Ryan has been treated similarly because she has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I have been criticised for the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, ironically, similar issues with which Jeremy did not agree with previous Heads of State or.
The communication for the East Labour in Nottingham meeting on Friday says: 'We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
Most of my time as a local Labour MEP in eight years, Friday evening's GC meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a 'more friendly, gentler' policy has long been forgotten if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated, and any opinion will be judged by whether it is acceptable to party leaders.
This began shortly after Mr Jeremys took office, because my colleagues with whom I had previously thought I would have a similar political attitude were expecting me to make a U-turn and take positions with which I would never otherwise have agreed, whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – a tirade of abuse in the social media that calls for selection, denounces the politics of the center, and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
This experience has not only I made.
I do know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed to me tend to be political.
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members who are subjected every day to a flood of sexist or racist abuse, but who are never deterred.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the level of abuse has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn asserted last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and any motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules will make the party smaller.
Over the last two years, I have received a lot of advice on collecting my neck, not being so vocal, and then I would be “OK. ”
But for this reason I have not come into politics.
32 years ago, I joined Labour as a student because of the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had led to my classroom literally collapsed, and as a result I tried to promote better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local council or ministers.
I have never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
As far as my political positions were concerned, no one in Nottingham East should have been in any way confused; the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to those who supported the Friday request that I do not understand why they waste time and energy to remain loyal to me and the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that damages households, businesses and our public services.
But the only message I have is not about Nottingham, but about my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that I will not be holding any threats to withdraw or political opportunities from work, which I believe is the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr Unlay at the top
Two late Trios may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr has deserved to win this wonderful entertaining Tenent's Premiership Match of the day.
They now run the table as the only non-layer of the ten teams.
In the end, it was due to the outstanding defense of the host, but also to the fact that opportunities were better utilised.
"We were tested so far through our games and we are still unstuck, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Thanks to Ayr, they have made better use of their opportunities. ”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, compared by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, who was given for the game of Warrior, allowed Melrose to speak numbers, and Jason Baggot a non-related attempt to steal.
Climo performed Ayr ’ s lead with a penalty shot before he made a hit directly at the halfway stage, and then made a solo attempt to get him into the 17: 5 pause guide for Ayr.
Melrose began his second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to transform Baggot reduced the lag to five points.
After the reboot, Ayr built the lead as a drummer of Climo's lord Tom McCormick.
Ayr's current captain, Blair Mackerson, got the yellow card, and again Melden made the rose extra man pay with an unmodified Bruce Colvine attempt at the end of a heavy overhang of pressure.
However, the home page came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because of a Strike without Climo ball from the penalty limit, MacPherson made a touchdown, the penultimate Ayr back.
Climo converged, as almost after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrons Boxkick began and sent the flying ship Gregor Henry per pass to Tryy number five.
“Still Game ” tar with new career plans in the restaurant industry.

“The sea belongs to us ”: Bolivia, encircled by land, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific again.
Sailors patrol in La Paz a Rigging-clad-Marine Sanctuary District.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from the Titicaca Lake to the Amazon stand under the motto: “The sea belongs to us from legal grounds.
It is a duty to recover.
Throughout Bolivia, memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still alive - as is the desire to travel back to the Pacific.
These hopes may be at their peak for decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the dynamism, spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the result with a positive view," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, and hope that the tribunal in The Hague will favour Bolivia's claim that Chile will have to negotiate after decades of restless talks to grant Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia ’ s charismatic president – who faces a controversial re-election struggle next year – it also depends very much on Monday ’ s decision.
“We are on the verge of regaining access to the Pacific, ” he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts find it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that even a positive decision on Bolivia will not bring about change.
The Dutch UN body has no authority to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was' not complicated ', said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from advancing Bolivia ’ s cause, the last four years could have reversed it.
“The question of access to the sea is being used by the current Bolivian Government for its purposes, ” said Zárate.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric has destroyed every remaining Chilean goodwill, proposing.
Bolivia and Chile will resume negotiations at some point, but it will be difficult to continue talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia ’ s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had decided unusually quickly.
Monday will offer Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile, ” and an opportunity to put an end to 139 years of disagreements with varying benefits, ” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who continues to be one of Latin America ’ s most popular presidents, uses the issue of sea access politically for his purposes.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
“The result is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past. ”
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not come, unless it can trust the US.
North Korea ’ s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation will never use its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during a summit of the two rival leaders in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear disarmament in Singapore three months after the meeting with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il.
Ri says that it is “a dream, ” that sanctions continue to be imposed and the US ’ s opposition to a statement ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington wants to accept the declaration that Pyongyang has taken comprehensive disarmament measures.
Both Kim and the US want President Donald Trump to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is abandoning its arms arsenal, which probably considers the country to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Trump and Kim.

The orange, soft hand, filled with Raffia-Saum and a white leather handle, was the outstanding piece in the Jacobus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armrit said FEMAIL: "I expect to see great hats and beach bags next summer in the main roads.
John Edward: Language skills that are essential to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have a record of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with outstanding results, including single- and group successes in sports, art, music, and other community ventures.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are anxious to offer their students and parents the best level of service.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for further education, also at universities, for their desired careers, and for their role as a citizen of the world.
In the education sector, we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailored school curriculum, and we note that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a person in the language he understands, you reach his mind. ”
When you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart. ”
This makes an impressive illustration of the fact that we cannot rely on English only if we are to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of this year show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest number in independent schools.
68% of students who have studied foreign languages have reached the “Higher grade A ” higher class A.
The data collected by the 74 member schools of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students reached a “Higher grade A ” in Mandarin, while at the students learning German, French, and Spanish, respectively 72, 69, and 63 reached Level A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language subjects rank the same in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere as MINT subjects (mathematics, information technology, science and technology).
A 2014 British Commission survey of employment and qualifications revealed that 17% of the reasons why employers had difficulty filling jobs are attributable to a lack of language knowledge.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly imperative to prepare young people for their professional future.
These skills are essential in a globalised world, given more promising employment opportunities that require languages.
Regardless of the career someone chooses when he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a lifetime capability such as this.
With the possibility of communicating directly with people from abroad, a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage, namely 15%.
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today ’ s children.
When children learn to speak several languages – especially those of developing countries – they will later have better opportunities to find meaningful employment in the labour market.
The schools in Scotland differ in their language offerings.
Some schools focus on classical modern languages, while other languages that are most important for Britain in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese, will be taught.
Whatever your child is interested, a number of languages will always be available in independent schools, with teachers specialised in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland want to offer a learning environment that is well prepared for children, and they should be given the necessary tools for their success, whatever the future may be.
In today ’ s global business, languages are undeniably still important for the country ’ s future, and this must also be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be regarded as “international communication capabilities. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
La gentillesse du personnel et la disponibil.

LeBron directs Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
Soon it is so far, and the fans can fire LeBron James at his first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker-Trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in the opening season on Sunday in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will spend in the place is not yet decided.
Walton said on the official Lakers website: "It will be more than one and less than 48".
Laker reporter Mike Trudell twitted that James will probably play limited minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season games of the Lakers.
“I do not need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare me, ” he said.
Trump ’ s Rallye in West Virginia, YouTube Channel.
President Donald Trump is starting this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, with a flood of campaign events.
It is the first of five scheduled elections next week, and Trump will also visit the Republican states of Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his candidate ’ s endorsement of the Supreme Court remains pending, Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm elections, otherwise it is to be feared that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November.
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally this evening and how can you view it online?
Trump ’ s Rallye in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19 p.m. ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can track down Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will certainly respond to the hearings that will take place this week on charges of sexual abuse against his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, whose confirmation in office, which must be carried out by the Senate, has been postponed by at least a week until the end of the FBIT missions.
But the main goal of these electoral events is to mobilize the Republicans facing a critical election in November.
According to Reuters, the goal of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters with the five elections next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
“The majority in Congress is at the top of the president ’ s agenda, so he visits as many states as possible just before the start of the turbulent campaign season, ” said Reuters, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who does not want to be named.
According to the radio network West Virginia MetroNews, the electoral event that occurs this evening at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virgin, the state that he won in 2016 with more than 40%, for the second time this month.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who lags behind in polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, Politburo at the University of West Virginia, said that there is no good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to improve his poll values.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope of Sunday talks alive.
After three one-sided encounters, four players were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
The floating pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized, especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say the momentum is now?
“You had a six-point lead and now there are four, so there is a bit of momentum for us, ” said Jordan Spith, when he left for the day. ”
Europe is, of course, ahead of four points, and twelve more are still to be played.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel a little wind in their sails and there was much encouragement for them, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each have three out of four points.
Spith was superior from the beginning and set a good example.
These chicks became louder when his hand went on, he lost a decisive shot to reach a decision in game 4 after he and Thomas fell 2 points after 2 games.
His delight at putting on the 15th hole with which they won the match was that one thought he still believed in the victory of the Americans.
"You really have to concentrate strongly and worry about your own game," said Spith.
This is all that remains for each of those players.
18 holes to leave impression.
In the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than the Spith and Thomas.
Europe's quaint, but admirable couple is playing aimlessly and doing everything right.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not reach a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the rear nine on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
This race and the way in which their energy seems to flow from this crowds of spectators makes them a favourite on Sunday and if the sun passes through Le Golf National, there would be no more popular player who seals a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Probably both at the same time at different holes.
Speaking of a European victory now would be too premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short trial with Sergio Garcia, who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning.
With a Bogey and two Doubles on the first nine Spaniards and the Swede entered a hole from which they never came out again.
On Sunday there is no one who will help you out of your hole.
Because of the interactions between the mating, given advice, given advice, given advice and the way a strategy can change in the blink, it is very fascinating to observe the Fourballs and Foursomes from close proximity.
Europe has played better than a team so far and has taken on a significant lead in the last day, but this Foursome-concession has also shown that the team USA has the desire to fight what some, especially Stateside, have questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Final Day
Europe will use a solid advantage over the last day of the Ryder Cup after it came out of the four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a rival Tiger Woods to put their previous record in the Le Golf National on four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who dominated an American team fighting to secure the trophy, which she lost two years ago in Hazelnine, dominated the moralistic Fourballs, and won the series with 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the Vieren and won two games, but they could not digest the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 individual games from Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European Rookie who wins four points in a row, while he and Molinari, after a sensational weekend called "Molliwood", are only the second pair, which wins four points from their first four games in the story of the Ryder Cup.
After they destroyed Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, it was considered certain that they would beat a soiled Woods and American Rookie Bryson Dechameau through an even clearer 5 & 4.
Woods, who lashed himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed brilliant actions, but he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four times and four times, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning Fourball, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and beat in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world.
At a pleasant, airy day southwest of Paris, however, Europe did not have it in its own way.
The three main winners, Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, set the American benchmark on Saturday with two points.
They won a brave 2: 1 victory against the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Pouler in the 4-wheelsack and later returned to fight Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4: 3 in the 4-wheelsack after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the Ryder Cup story a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles, although holder Furyk's page needs only one draw to keep the trophy.
After two days of second order, however, a Sunday counter looks like he would go beyond them.
North Korea says that “by no means ” there will be unilateral disarmament without trust.
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen his distrust of the United States, and that, in no case, the country would unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons under such.,, however, would the United States.
Ri Yong Ho said to the global body ’ s annual general assembly that North Korea took "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test base and the obligation not to spread nuclear and nuclear technology.
"There is no such answer from the USA," he said.
“Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we can first disarm unilaterally. ”
While Ri revived the known North Korean grievances about Washington ’ s opposition to a “gradual ” approach to denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps, his explanation seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization completely, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri drew attention to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-Il and Donald Trump at a first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to working toward “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, ” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea ’ s security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
The US insists on "denuclearization first" and increases the pressure from sanctions to achieve its purpose in a binding way, and even reject the "declaration of the end of war", said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust. ”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US President emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister raised three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the last five months and added: 'If the party were to be on this issue of denuclearization and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end'.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N., and the General Assembly, targeting the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles, was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President ” Trump called Kim a“ missile man ” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy ” North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but he also said that much work still needed to be done, and sanctions must remain until North Korea eliminated denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not have a timeframe for this, saying: 'It does not matter whether it takes two years, three years, or five months'.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, in the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN, the Security Council on Thursday: 'The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously and without a lack of deficiency until we realize the full, final and verified denuclearization'.
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the financing of the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes involving Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress has been made, and only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him to “meet similar demands. ”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes' appropriate measures'.
He said Kim told him that the "related measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps to normalization relations with Washington.
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace.
With a new course this year at Harvard University, all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying the koufeintook "through nights".
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unsuspecting when it comes to helping themselves, even when it comes to very simple mechanisms.
Charles Czisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course he believes to be the first of his kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
In the end, a girl came to me and said: "Why is this only now, in my final year, said?
She said that she never told anyone of the meaning of the sleeping, which surprised me, "he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University ’ s Health Service, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found that students had slept extremely little during the week.
The 1 hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how sporting performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of sleeping time routine.
Another section explains to participants how long lasting sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to reflect on their daily life.
We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
"But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes," Prof. Czisler added.
The culture of pride still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students make sleeping deprivation a growing problem.
Enough sleep of good quality should be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion, and fear, he said - also to not accept sleep deprivation, because sleep takes the brain into starvation mode and makes it constantly hungry.
Raymond Thus, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, Professor Czisler helped design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push a Campuswide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to call on all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before entering the school.
Prof. Czisler recommended the students to set an alert when they should go to bed and when they should wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can bring their circular rhythm out of the run, which leads to problems when they sleep.
Livingston 1-0 Ranger: Mengas Goudal et Gerrads Men
Further upside problems of the Ranners: After a hit by Dolly Menga, in Livingston the 1-to-0 defeat for the unsome team of Steven Gerrard.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since the 4th: 1-triumph in February in St. Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrard's to in, and.
Menga had a hit seven minutes prior to the half, and an inspiring rankings didn ’ t look as though she could bring a balance.
While the Rangers now fall back to the sixth place, Livington climb to rank three and are only behind Hibernian because of the Tordifferential.
New difficulties for the Rangers are apparent, as the Calum Spence liner had to be given a head hit after it was hit by a litter object – thrown out of the range of outreach fans.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed to Ayr and moved straight into the semi-finals of the Betvian Cup.
In contrast, Holt raised the same Livi-Elf, who dropped a point last week ’ s hearing, and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well trained team did not leave any room for action to the opponents at any time.
The Rangers were dominated by ball ownership, but Livington had better opportunities.
You should have hit after only two minutes, when Mengas sent first pile Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor Tor, but the middle field player rolled his big change past the gate.
A deeper Freightur of Keaghan Jacobs then went to captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgov could only shoot far in the direction of upright posts.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than unthinking in their own game, the last third.
Alfredo Morelos, after the end of the first quarter of an hour, was clearly of the opinion that he deserved an Elfmeter after he and Steven Lawless had clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson did not follow the appeals of Colombians.
The Ranners only reach two shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox-Torkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly the head of Lassanna Coulibys and the hit of a bissloze Ovi Ejaria.
Even if Livis ’ s opening meeting in the 34th minute may have been contrary to the running, no one can deny that she deserved it for her efforts alone.
Again, the Rangers failed to manage a Jacobean condition.
Scott Arfield didn't react as Declan Nelson Scott Robinson played the ball, saving the rest and selecting Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged cannibaly against Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played Morelos, but the impressive Kelly moved from his line to block.
But Livingston repeatedly drew guests to play exactly the kind of games they like, with Lithgov and Halkett wearing long balls after long balls.
Holts ’ team could have expanded their leadership in the final stage, but McGregor was well positioned to deny Jacobs, before Lithgov was away from the corner.
The Ranger representative Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to a penalty, because he promised his with Jacobs, but again he saw Thomson deranged.
Almunach: The inventor of the violin counter
And now a page from our almanac after “Sunday morning ”: 30 September 1882, that was more than 136 years ago... The day on which the future physicist John Wilhelm, called Hans, Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that finally brought the device known as Geiger meters.
The Geiger counter has since also become a mainstream of science, as in the 1950s, "Bells of Coronado", the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What about everything in the world is that? '
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released from radioactivity into the minerals. ”
Evans: ‘ Just say, now it is weening but it ’!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears its name will continue to be used.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” malign cells.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” and kill malign cells.
vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malign cells as part of treatment.
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells of a patient, modification of these in the laboratory.
You can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then injected again.
A study impfstoff shows promising results for patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who helped to recognize rogue cells, saw their ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient to change them in the laboratory, so that a protein called HER2 is “visible ” that occurs in many types of cancer, and then re-injected the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings point to us having a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancer ”, including breast, eggs, lung and intestinal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky declared.
A similar approach to taking patients from immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia.
After his appearance at Night Saturday Live, Kanye West, dressed with a MAGNA cap, ran a pro-Trump Tirade from the pile.
It did not go well. and,,,,,,
In the studio during a Saturday Night, Kanye West ran a live show after a speech in which he praised the US.
After having performed his third song of the night, Ghost Town, while he was wearing a Make America Great hat, he looked against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"As often I speak with a white person and she says," How can you like Trump, he is a racist? "
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have been out of America long ago, "he said.
The Saturday-Night-Live Show began with a sketch in which Hollywood Star Matt Damon made her sexually compelling about Brett Kavanugh's statement in front of the Senate Justice Committee concerning Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that Kavanaugh had.
Although it was not broadcast, the film material was shared by West ’ s Burleitz by the comedian Chris Rock in the Social Media.
It is unclear whether Rock has tried to mock West with the contribution.
West too had complained to the audience that he had had had trouble behind the stage because of his headgear.
"They harassed me behind the stage.
You said, 'Don't go out with the hat'.
You have annoyed me!
And then they say that I am in a given place, "he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Want to see the sunken place?" and said that he would "attract my superman cloak, because that means that you can't tell me what I want to do, you want the world?,, and,, and,,, and,,,,,
Try it with love. ”
His comments were received at least twice by the audience at Buhring and the comedies of Saturday Night Live appeared to be moved, reported Variety and quoted a person with the words: “The whole studio was totenstill. ”
West was later used as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapp Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with a performance of the song "I Love it", as Perrier Bottle disgusted.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, the bitterness: “This is for one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU, THAT DU DIACH OF MAFIA WILL HART. ”
But Talkmmasterin Karen Hunter twined that West simply "is what he is, and that is absolutely wonderful".
“But I will not reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his art), which I believe he is adopting and distributing an ideology that is harmful to my community. ”
It is free.
We also 'added it.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and now called the being formelly known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change their name and enters the footprints of Diddy, also known as Pud Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Mitraptor Snoop Dogg had the name of Snoop Lion and of course the later music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Kit, which recently had his co-Star Rose Leslie, also 31, married, admitted that he considered it very important to solve the problem.
I personally feel quite strong at the moment - what did we do wrong with masculinity?, he said.
What have we taught men in their youth about the problem we are now seeing?
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic makeup by its very masked characters.
It taught: What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the street gives the little boy the feeling that they have to have this particular side of being.
I think that this is really one of the great questions at our time – how can we change that?
For young men, it is obvious that something went wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make a game of thrombosis precursor or competitions if the series ended next summer, and added that he was finished with Battlegrounds and horses.
In November, kit will play a new version of Sam Shepard's True West, which deals with the story of a film producer and a robber, his brother.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best that came with vGame of Thrones.
He said: "I met my wife in this show, so she gave me my future family and a new life".
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit-Darwriter Jon Snow, in the Emmy-award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family ownership in Scotland.
HIV / AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% among its fellow citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to the health authorities, there are 820,000 people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have passed the virus through sexual intercourse, which is a change over the past.
HIV generally spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who were affected by HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Compared to the previous year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
Transferring HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuals has no longer been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Studies estimate that 70 – 90% of men who have sex with men marry women at the end of the country due to the country ’ s conservative values.
These diseases are often transmitted by unprotected sex.
In 2003, China ’ s government promised universal access to HIV medicines in an attempt to contain the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has read the data of GOP senators, criticises the accusations as “dangerous lies ” and“ conspiracy theories. ”
On Saturday, the US MP Maxine Waters rejected claims that one of their staff should have published personal data from three Republican US senators on the lawmakers ’ side.
The democrat, based in Los Angeles, is convinced that the claims of members of the ultra-dark wing and websites were launched.
“lies, lies, and even more lies lies, ” Waters shared an opinion on Twitter.
According to the information published, the private addresses and telephone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and US Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah, were reported.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing about the accusations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters's office and published the information of an employee of Waters.
“This unjustified accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie, ” says Waters.
“The employee of my employees – whose identity, personal information, personal data, and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for the fact that this information was read.
This groundless claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie.
Waters's statement quickly led online to criticism, including the former White House secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
“The fact that the matter is denied is extremely annoying, ” he wrote.
“This suggests that it is inappropriate as a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of having done something, he must not be evil.
They must not be bored.
They must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
They must be quiet and left. ”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters ’ response with the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of offending them during the Thursday hearing.
Likewise, Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran near the sedentary river in the midterm elections, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Big, if true, ” he got married.
In her statement, Waters said that her office "informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about the fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are apprehended and their actions, which have a destructive and dangerous impact on my employees, continue to be held accountable. ”
Review by "Johnny English - You live only triple" - badly filled parody with Rowan Atkinson.
It is a tradition to search for hints in every new film with a British tendency to Brexit, and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action-Comedy-Spomp, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was launched again in 2011 with "Johnny English Reborn".
Is the ironic self-sation of the abyss the nation ’ s new export opportunity?
In any case, for the second time, the gloomish, gummifaceless and incompetent Johnny English has obtained the license to break things up again.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to Smoothie-Glamour, got a bit of clouseau, a knight Mr. Bean and a punch from this guy, and who has contributed a single note to the leitmelodie of the fire brigade car at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is also based on the traveller and international, mysterious Atakinson, who once played a part in the now-forgotten Barclays TV show, is always in chaos.
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny England combination.
I loved Johnny English, who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and beats the main rotor briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for body humor is to be seen, but the humor feels rather weak and strange superfluous, especially since the "serious" footage like 007 and Mission Impossible self-confidently offer comedy as ingredient.
The humor feels rather like being directed to children rather than adults, and for me the crazy misadventures of Johnny English are not so inventive and focused as Atkinson Mr. answering films.
The perennial premise is that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the service agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much in the script to work with.
Their intelligence advisers inform them that, as each individual active spy has been compromised, she has to pick someone out of the retirement.
And this means that the awesome Johnny English itself, which is currently employed as a schoolmaster in an noble institution, but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as a Undercover agent: some nice gags here, while English offers a school of rock academy on espionage.
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency war and reunited with his former long-suffering Kumpel Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander, an overtired, burschic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully applicable.
So, the Batman and Robin the Chaos of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet on Olga Kurylenka's beautiful wife Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously attacking the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems: the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of the colorful Highjinks: as a waiter they ignited a French Flash restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas luxury yachts; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarise himself with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas house.
For this last sequence, all registers have certainly been drawn, but they are so gracious and left out, the whole thing is reminiscent of children's.
That is, strictly speaking.
And as with the other Johnny England movies, I could not fail to think: can the British film industry, Rowson, not give a role that really does justice to its talent?
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week, for which five days will be paid.
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is testing a radical plan, with Britons working only four days a week, but paid for five.
According to reports, the party wants heads of companies to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day.
Staff would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still receive the same amount of money.
Sources said that the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plan to overturn it in favour of workers.
The trade union congress has approved the changeover to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy.
A high-level Labour source said the Sunday Times: a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
A four-day week is an objective that matches the party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance for workers and the party ’ s general industrial strategy, but that goal will not be achievable overnight.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017.,,,,,,,,,,
However, this advance is currently not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party".
Last week ’ s Labour Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Party Secretary John McDonnell took advantage of his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' in utilities.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share, because a Labour Government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers into business management and to create inclusive ownership funds to allocate 10% of private-sector equity to employees receiving annual dividends of up to <unk> 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “60 minutes ” about whether FBITs ’ anti-Kavanaugh might change their minds.
On the basis of an ongoing FBI investigation into allegations of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on the Supreme Court ’ s appointment was postponed by at least a week, and the question is raised as to whether the results of the FBI ’ s investigation might lead to the suspension of support for Kavanaugh.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Peley, a correspondent of “60 minutes, ” Republican Senators John Kennedy, and Lindsey Graham, questioned whether the FBI ’ s investigative findings could persuade them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Anyway, ” Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened after that claim came out, I said: 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, targeted, clear '.
Graham's voice, however, seemed to be cast in stone.
"I have an opinion on board Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb attack," he said.
“Dr Ford, I do not know what has happened, but I know that board strongly disputed the charge, ” Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of them they called could confirm it.
It is 36 years ago.
I see nothing new that changes. '
"What is the Global Cities Festival and has ensured that poverty is reduced?"
This Saturday, the Global Cities Festival takes place in New York, an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world.
This year ’ s seventh Global Cities Festival will bring tens of thousands of people together at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the event: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which took place in 2012, is an extension of Global Poverty Projects, an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event, the concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, an email to a leader in the world, a telephone call or another useful way of increasing the goal of combating poverty and raising awareness of it.
But how successful has Global Cities been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a real opportunity to convince people to call for action, or simply another case of what is called 'ClickActivism' - people who feel that signing an online petition or an online application, or by doing so, sending a Tweet as if they make a real difference?
Global Citizen says that, since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions ” by its supporters pushing for a variety of different goals.
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group made 390 bets and announcements from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that the funds allocated thus far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and executive organizations committed to “helping children to develop their full potential. ” The organization has promised to help Rwanda, at $35 million, stop malnutrition in the country after Global Citizenship received more than 4,700 tweets.
“With support from the British Government, the donor, other state governments, and global citizenship as you can make the social injustice of malnutrition one day history, ” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman announced the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions in the UK aimed at improving maternal and child nutrition, the government will achieve the funding of the 'Power of Nutrition' project for 5 million women and children with dietary interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty? ”
Global citizens responded: it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
Like the great civil law and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
The stars Janet Jackson, Weegd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be present at this year ’ s New York event, hosted by Abe Lee ra-Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the navy to build a “blockade ” to hinder Russian energy exports – Interior Minister.
Washington can use its navy, if necessary, to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zike is quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zike argued that Russia ’ s engagement in Syria – particularly in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe, ” he said.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to circumvent them.
"The United States has this ability to use our navy to ensure that maritime routes are open, and if necessary to block, in order to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants in an event of Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the “voice of energy consumers ” in the US.
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to Russia and Iran, and found that they are indeed the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less about using and replacing fuels," he said, while he called Russia a "one-trick honor" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The opinions come when the Trump administration was on the mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia, which is a far more favourable option for European consumers.
Trump members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to move Germany toward a halt to the “inadequate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, would make Berlin“ captured ” in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure, and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, ” said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US ’ s stance has provoked a backlash from Germany, confirming its commitment to the project.
Germany ’ s leading industrial organization, the Federal Association of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state enters our energy supply," said the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), Dieter Kempf, after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Take "Hard Look" At Running For President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would seriously consider the presidential candidacy after the mid-term election.
During a Council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will look seriously at the presidential candidate.
President Donald Trump was charged with hearings during the Rauthausen and said that he is heading 'this country in the wrong direction'.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren did not mince his mouth in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said in a Tweet on Friday: 'Of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote'.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe that it should run in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe, 58 percent of the "likely" vote of authority, voters said that the Senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported such a run.
The survey showed more support for a race of the former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential run and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile democrats that are being discussed with regard to a possible candidacy in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden would officially decide until January.
Sarah Palin cited Track Palin ’ s PTSD for Donald Trump ’ s campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after it was convened in September.
He was arrested and charged for alleged domestic violence on Monday evening.
“In the light of what my own son is running through what he has just passed after he has returned, I can understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning to, ” she told the public at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room, ” and said about her son and other veterans:“ They come back a bit differently, coming back harder, asking whether the work of their fellow soldiers and the air force and all other members of the military is respected for the country. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic acts of violence against a woman, obstruction of an advertisement for domestic violence and possession of a weapon in an intoxicating state, Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police.
18 states D. C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy
18 states and Washington, D.C. support a legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to the victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives from the 18 states and the district in Washington on Friday submitted an Amicus Curiae (Friend of the Court) to support an asylum seeker in the contest.
The full name of the plaintiff in the legal dispute of Grace against sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal law in August is unknown.
She said that her partner "and his violent sons of band members" had abused them, but on 20 July US officials refused to apply for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers supporting Grace called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which comprise a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations struggling with serious problems involving gangs and domestic violence.
The US ’ s new asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Appeals for Immigrants from 2014 that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can apply for asylum.
The Justice Minister of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in an opinion on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national, federal and international law.
The Amicus Curiae states that, according to federal law, all applications for asylum must be assessed according to the circumstances of the respective complaint and such action violates this principle.
lawyers continued to argue in the paper that policies refusing entry to immigrants are damaging the US economy, because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and “do necessary work. ”
Attorney General Jeff sessions instructed immigrant magistrates in June to no longer grant asylum to people fleeing domestic or gang exile.
“Asylum belongs to those who have to leave their country for persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or affiliation to a particular social group or because of political opinion, ” said sessions in his statement on the law of 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems, even the serious people facing every day in the world.
Desperate bailouts in Palu, while the number of casualties in the race doubled with the search for survivors.
The situation has become increasingly dramatic for the survivors.
“The situation is very tense, ” said the 35-year-old Kudura Risa, who has found shelter with her nasty baby in a evacuation centre in the urban area of Pali.
“Anduring will bring corpses.
Clean water is scarce “.
Residents were watching back in their homes destroyed, taking on completely damaged personal items and trying to save what was to be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals that were devastated by the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 were completely overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, with a breach of the back and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu army hospital, where patients were treated for prolonged heavy aftershocks.
tears filled his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We had no time to be certain.
I think I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, "said Haris to Associated Press.
I heard my wife cry for help and then it was quiet.
I do not know what has become of her and our child ”.
I hope they are safe. ”
US ambassador accuses China of “bullying ” with“ propaganda advertising. ”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page display in a US daily on the mutual benefit of US China trade, the US ambassador to China published in Beijing to use the American press for propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's pay in the Des Moines Register - the state with Iowa's most sold newspaper - after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections of 6 November, which China denies.
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge of interfering with the US election in Beijing is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign states to turn on ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war with multiple rounds of tariffs on imports.
In an early phase of trade war, China ’ s retaliation tariffs should be met by Chinese and US experts, with exporters in US states like Iowa, where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live.
Terry Branstad, United States Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing hurt American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a letter in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, “is now firmly using propaganda in our own free press.
“By spreading propaganda as a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, China ’ s government takes advantage of the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom, ” wrote Branstad.
"By contrast, you will find only limited voices in the newspaper stand in Beijing ’ s streets, and you will not see any real refusion of different opinions that the Chinese people might have on China ’ s disturbing economic development, given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers opposed the offer for publication," although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans compared the Cavanath debacle of Midtermm elections, warned analysts
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh, a nominee for the Supreme Court, even though he was accused of sexual assault, while analysts warn that they will see a retaliation in the upcoming elections, especially women.
The emotions were high, most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him.
These things cannot be attributed, said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, on Saturday in an article published by The Hill.
Reeher said, he doubt that the last-minute support of Jeff Flake (Republican Member for the Arizona State) would be enough for FBI investigation to reconcile anger.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November, ” said Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Citizen, and National spokeswoman for the progressive group MovOn on Friday, as reported by a Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang: “November is coming! ” while demonstrating in the Senate ’ s hall, when the Republicans who control the Committee of Justice decided to continue with Kavanath ’ s nomination despite what Dr Christine Blasey Ford said, Mic.
“The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable, ” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, the journalists.
“People say that it is quite advanced, that is true.
But the figure could be higher, especially in pre-urban voters and younger voters, 18-to-29, who may not suffer the president, but often do not vote. ”
Already before Ford ’ s public statement in which she expressed her accusations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that a backlash could follow if Republicans bid.
“For GOP, this has become a raging chaos, ” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not just about the election of the committee or the final election, or whether Kavanaugh is placed on the replacement bank, it is about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it, ” said Guy Cecil, director of the priorities of the United States, a group that helps the Democrats to elect the news station.
But Americans are divided about what Ford and Kavanaugh have said.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the questioned Ford testimony definitely or probably believed, while 35 percent indicate that they definitely believed or probably cavanaugh.
Moreover, 38% said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lied during his statement, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
On the initiative of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations of Ford and at least one more accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford said last week before the Senate Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez accused the highest court of judges, while studying at Yale in the 1980s, at a party in front of her.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Internet, establishes a start-up company that is to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The current technology legend, Inert, is a company that builds on the OpenSource platform of Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee argued that the objective of Inert is to take over world domination.
“We must do it now, ” he said about the start-up.
“It is an historic moment. ”
The App uses the technology of Solid, which allows users to create personal online data storage or a POD.
The data storage can include contact lists, tasks lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or professional tools.
It is available like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all on a browser and all at the same time.
The special thing about personal data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to decide what kind of information is possible.
The company calls it “enabling people through data. ”
According to the CEO of John Bruce, Inert will provide resources, processes and relevant know-how to make Solid a broad user accessible.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some employees involved in the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
As of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the int site.
Berners-Lee said that neither his team nor him will talk to Facebook and Google about the major changes that will put all previous business models overnight.
“We will not ask for permission. ”
In an article published on the medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solidly built web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has strongly influenced the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
During the launch of Inert, Berners-Lee remains founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the Internet, ” Berners-Lee noted.
Bernard Vann: Victoria-Crusaders from World War I will be honoured.
The only priest of the Church of England, who received a Victoria-cross during World War I, was celebrated 100 years later in his home city.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann earned the award on September 29, 1918 at the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper in the car and did not know that he won the highest British military award.
A monument was unveiled by his two grandchildren on Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamtonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “incredibly symbolic ” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic achievements.
According to the London Gazette, in September 1918, Colonel Vann conducted his battalion via the channel of Saint-Quentin “in very dense fog and under heavy attack by fieldpieces and machine guns. ”
Later, he moved up to the firing line, leading the line forward with the “biggest Galanterie ” before he moved one field gun and pushed three times the departure.
Lieutenant General Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just under a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said the actions of his grandfather were "something that I know could never do justice to, something that truly instils humility".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also brought down a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honoured to attend the parade ” and added:“ The bravery of a real hero is reflected in the support he gets from many people. ”
MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead got Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you've stayed awake all night to see the entire Bellator 206-event just to see the main event.
The San Jose plan had 13 battles, including six main battles and was shown live in the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just then as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were prepared to confront each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were able to see how media coverage on Peppa Pig was switched.
Some were unprinted after they were awake until the early hours, especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change to the children's box as "some sick joke".
"It is a state rule that at 6 o'clock in the morning these contents were not suitable, so they had to change to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication, when asked for the transfer.
"Peppa the pip," yes. "
Bellator Managing Director Scott Coker said that they will work on their planning in the future to include British viewers.
"If I think about the repetition, we will somehow get it up," he said.
"But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday there and we will only be able to fix it on Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it was turned off, a lot was written and the contents were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it would be a technical error.
But it was not, it was a problem for the government.
I can promise you that it will not happen next time.
We will reduce it to five rather than six fights - as we normally do - and we have tried to outdo the fans and have simply gone over.
It is an adverse situation. '
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality.
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling that he had lost all due to his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said that he was only aware at secondary school that “not everyone is like me. ”
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4, Lauren Laverne said he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope. ”
He also said that victory at the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him.
The regular presenter of the show, Kristiy Young, has taken off for several months due to an illness.
Daley appeared in Lavernes ’ first program, saying that he felt “less worth ” than the others as a growth, because“ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women. ”
He said: “To this day, these feelings of the Weniger Wert and otherness gave me the strength and strength, I needed you to be successful., ”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he meant to disappoint no one when he got away from his sexual orientation.
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to criminalise homosexuality.
He said he was saying that he was fortunate enough to live openly and without consequences, and because he wanted to give others' hope '.
Three times the world champion said that he fell in love with a man, the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, which he was very surprised about.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but the age difference was never a problem.
“If so much is done at such a young age, ” he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at 14 years, three years later his father died of cancer – he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had lived similar highs and lows.
The couple was in June parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "full perspective" had changed.
“Last year, everything turned to me to win a gold medal, ” he said.
"But know what is more important than Olympic gold.
My gold medal is Robbie. ”
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011 after a cancer diagnosis for only 40 years.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row.
“I could not tell him: <unk> You will not experience sitting in the first row, Dad <unk>, he said.
“I kept his hand when his breathing was suspended.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I had dreamed of this throughout my life – diving into the water at the Olympics – there is no better feeling, ” he said.
He has also inspired his first choice of songs – Proud from Heath Small.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC-Radio 4 on Sunday at 11: 15 pm BST.
The informal Mickelson sat on the Ryder Cup-Saturday in the Bank.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup-game, but he must dramatically improve his shape so that it won't be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years, was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead, as is so often the case for the US, the five-fold Major Winner shared his day between Anfire and practice rounds on the golf course, hoping to overcome his depth.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old driver is never the most straightforward driver and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square, where the long Rough regularly punishes false.
And as if the square wasn ’ t challenging enough, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson meets the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches this week together with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans lost four points at the start of the 12 individual games and got a hot start, Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man; what left him other.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a Klamt on his back and put his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has great self-confidence.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably would not have thought he was playing two games.
I wanted more, but this is the way in which we had to get it done.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
So far, Nick Faldo keeps the record of most of the matches played at the Ryder Cup, which will break Micon on Sunday.
This could mark the end of an Ryder Cup career that never really stuck to the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson played 18 times, 20 times lost and 7 times a tie.
"He is funny, he is sarcastic, funny, he loves to talk people, and he is a great guy he can have in the team room," he explained.
I think the younger players had fun this week to compete with him, that was a nice look. ”
It offers much more than just the game. ”
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a major lead will soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a great advance in the individual games of the last day can quickly become an uncomfortable spectacle.
The Dane debut was in Valderama in 1997, where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans, but only barely reached the finishing line and won 13 <unk> with an immense lead of 14 <unk>.
"One remembers that one was in Valderama; we had a great lead in Brookline, where we lost.
The story will show me and all in this team that it is not over.
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow.
Get out and make the right things.
It is only by displaying the points on the table.
Our goal is to win this Cup, and we focus on that.
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team, but we are dealing with a strong opponent, the best players in the world. ”
Again, Björn added: "I would never be over again.
Tomorrow is also a day.
Tomorrow personal performances are coming, and that is another thing.
It ’ s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but if you ’ re out there alone, your golf players will be tested on the whole.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: get the best out of it tomorrow.
Now you get over to your partner and you have to make full use of it. ”
In contrast to Björn, the opposing player Jim Furyk will seek to make his players better on one hand than they do as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turn in the final day, when he was part of the Brookline winning team, now he is one of the losers after the European team finished the “miracle of Mediclose. ”
"I remember every worthy word," he said how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players on the way to the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as soon as possible, as you saw in Brookline, in Medinear.
Once a dynamic of its own has evolved, it is exerting great pressure on the medium matches.
We have built up our layout accordingly and got the guys out as we felt, you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow. ”
Thomas, together with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European on the top in the ranking, should lead the counterstrike against Rory McIlroy in the top game.
I set up this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way, "said Bjorn about his individual selection.
Renewed postponement of the timetable for Germany ’ s new ship
The German Navy ’ s latest atrocity should have been put in service in 2014 to replace long-winded Cold War warships, with reports of faulty systems and escalating costs, but it will now take at least until next year.
The commissioning of the “Rhineland Pfalz ”, the flagship of the brand new retail retail retail of Baden-Württemberg ’ s class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, the newspaper“ Time ” referring to a military speaker.
The Navy should have started vessels in 2014, but the ambitious project was burdened by serious problems following the first delivery.
The four ships in 2007 were replaced by the Marine sellers of the Baden-Württemberg Württemberg class.
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some steam technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important advantage is longer service intervals: the latest frigates should be used for up to two years without running the home port.
However, the ultra-modern warships that Germany is supposed to allow for an overseas power projection will already be obsolete if they are finally put in service, as the weekly newspaper “Time ” notes.
The ill-fated F125-Fregat made headlines last year, when the German navy officially refused to take the ship into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return of ships; German media mentioned a series of critical “software and hardware defects ” that would make the ship useless in combat missions.
Software defects were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg Baden-Württemberg Baden-Württemberg class were operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the crew were employed on the older spouses of the Bremen class.
It also turned out that the ship is overweight, limiting its performance and making future upgrades more difficult for the Navy.
It is assumed that the 7.0-tonne "Rhineland Palatinate" is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including crew training - is also discussed.
Instead of the original estimated EUR 2.2 billion, the cost now seems to have reached a staggering figure of EUR 3.1 billion (around $3.6 billion).
The problems with the latest spouses are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s sailor is slipping away.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Defence Committee, stated that the fleet of war actually “runs out the ships that can be used. ”
The official said that the problem has grown smoothly over time, as old ships have been left out of service without there being any substitute for it.
He complained that none of the spouses of Baden-Württemberg were served by the navy.
The National Trust covers the secret life of bats.
New research on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland tries to find out how bats use the landscape for food search.
It is hoped that it will gain new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammalian animals, which can provide guidance for future action to protect animals.
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pistols as well as brown longhorns and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special reception equipment are placed at main points of the accommodation to watch bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings determine the frequency of bat calls and assign the calls to the species.
The habitat map to be drawn and the report accompanying it should give a detailed overview of the behaviour.
Rob Dewar, National Trust for Scotland (NTS), hopes to find out what areas of life are most important for the bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of life space management, such as Wiesenbildung and how forests are best maintained for bats and other related species.
For the bats in Scotland and the whole of Britain, there has been a sharp decline in the last hundred years.
They are threatened by construction works that affect their sleeping places and the loss of habitat.
There is also a risk to wind farms and lighting, as well as fly loops and some chemical treatments of building materials.
bats are not blind.
When it comes to hunting at night, the ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a sophisticated echo tracking technology to locate bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect sleeping places and sometimes also perform rescues.
The organization has even set up Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated battalion camp in the county of Greece in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten Scottish bats are based.
According to Manager David Thompson, the property is an ideal habitat for them:
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats. ”
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and the whole good habitat.
But there are still a lot of unknown about bats and the work we do here and elsewhere helps us to understand better what they need to live. ”
He stresses that it is important to check in buildings before maintenance work whether bats are there, killing up to 400 female and, a local population may be.
bats are protected; it is forbidden to kill, harass or interrupt them and destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are. ”
Ronaldo claims rape as a lawyer sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has had rape claims against him as "fake news" and claims that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “Der Spiegel ”, which published the allegations.
He was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel hotel hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.,, and.
He was supposed to pay her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, The Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33 in an instant live video to his 142 million followers, reported the reports as “fake news. ”
No, no, no, no.
What they say today, Fake News, ” said the five-time balloon D'Or winner in the camera.
“You want to apply for yourself by using my name.
“That is normal.
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a happy person, and everything is good, ” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers have filed a lawsuit against the magazine “Der Spiegel ” for claims; according to Reuters, you referred to“ an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy. ”
Norbert Christian Schertz said that the player will demand damages for “immaterial damage in the amount of the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
In June 2009, the alleged incident was reported in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to records submitted to the District Court of Clark County in the U.S. state of Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player ’ s room where he raped them in a nightclub.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to the knees after the alleged incident, saying that he was “99% ” a“ good guy ” left in the lurch by the “one percent ”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and made photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an extra-judicial agreement because she had "fear of retribution" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to declare the agreement invalid because it remains traumatized by the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was about to change to Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and this summer switched to the Italian giant Juve with a 100-million Euro deal.
Brexit: Britain would always regret losing automakers
“The United Kingdom would regret it in life if it lost its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, ” said Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK announced to the BBC that they would temporarily cease production at their plant in Burnaston, near Derby, if British businesses left the EU without a deal.
“We need an agreement, ” said Clark.
Japan ’ s car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, produced by the brands Auris and Avensis for Toyota, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement, I believe that our plant will end up with production stops, ” said Marlin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will finish its work in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The most important concerns relate to what car manufacturers are saying about the supply chain ’ s risks in the event of a “no deal Brexit. ”
The production facilities of Toyota are based on needs-based manufacturing, that is, the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for special products.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there may be delays on the border, which, according to industry specifications, may lead to supply shortages and partial shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of the stock in his plant in Derbyshire, the company said, and so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said, Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “closely calibrated to avoid such border controls. ”
We need to have a deal, we want the best deal that not only allows us to succeed, we also want to seize this opportunity, ” he said to the BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
“The reference not only to Toyota, but also to other manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains. ”
However, Toyota did not provide information on how long the production freeze might last, but warned that the increase in costs could, in the long term, suffer the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, trade union representative and for 24 years in Burnaston said that union members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that once they have been cut, jobs are lost forever. ”
One speaker said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU'.
Trump ’ s rose-stone meeting could shift again, says the White House
Donald Trump ’ s high-class meeting with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed another week, ” as the battle for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, read the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of the Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who examined Russian interventions in the elections, connections between Trump and Russia, and the possible obstruction of the president ’ s judiciary.
Whether Trump will or will not fire the Deputy Prosecutor, and thus endanger Müller ’ s independence, Washington has sent a lot of gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th Constitution addition.
Rosenstein rejected an opinion.
But last Monday he came to the White House, while there were reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would prefer not to shoot Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with Senate Justice Committee hearing, in Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual misbehavior.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh and continued to delay a full Senate vote.
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesperson Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rose Stone meeting, she said: 'A date for this has not yet been set, it could be this week, I could see that I went back another week, given all the other things that go before the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always keep the press informed. '
Some reporters would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The guest Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to television reporters, who were like self-directed, but she also said: 'I will not oppose being in the gallery'.
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President presents more questions and answers than any President before him," she said and added, without giving evidence, "We have looked at these figures."
briefing is still going to take place, Sanders said, but the press should have the opportunity to put the questions directly to the President of the United States, if that is infinitely better than to talk to her.
We are trying to do much of that and you have seen how we have done this in recent weeks, and it will replace a press debate if you can talk to the President of the United States itself. ”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with one person are rare.
In New York, the president perhaps demonstrated this week why he made a free-running and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters.
Brexit ’ s Health Minister ’ s Letter to EU Workers in the NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health has written EU staff in Scotland ’ s NHS to the country ’ s gratitude and the wish that they will remain after Brexit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, etc.
The Scottish MEP Jane Freeman wrote her letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has agreed to accept the costs of the agreed status appeals for EU citizens working in its decentralized public service.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, heading towards expected decisions in the autumn.
But the British Government has also intensified preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat now how much I would appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring with it valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve our health care system and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
Scotland is certainly your home and we want it to remain. ”
Christoon Abercrombie is undertaking an emergency operation after a head injury.
The Country State Tiger Defenders Christoon Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation after a head injury in the 31 to 27 defeat on Saturday against the Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday.
Tennessee State Head Coach Rod Reed said that the injury occurred just before the middle.
"He came to the side line and simply collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainer and medical personnel provided oxygen to Abercrombie on the side line before it was placed on a grave and taken for further investigation.
An official of Tennessee State said Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had survived the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is no details of the nature and severity of the violation ” and that Tennessee State ’ s attempts to find out when he committed the violation.
Abercrombie, a Rothemd in the second year, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He landed five Tackles on Saturday before leaving the pitch, bringing his seasonal total worth to 18 Tackles.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher stamps tax if they buy a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on stamps if they buy a property in Britain with the extra money used to help homeless in the context of new Tory plans.
This move will neutralise Corbyns ’ ambition to attract young voters.
The United Kingdom ’ s Stamp Tax is levied on those who do not pay taxes.
The Treasury expects more than GBP 120 million a year to go to support the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax rate when buying real estate in Britain - the additional money will be used for the homeless, says Theresa May today.
This step is seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn ’ s success, attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to pursue high incomes.
The stamp fee is levied on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will help the government to combat homelessness.
The premium - added to the current stamps tax, including the increases in two-year stays and rentals - could be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects GBP 120 million per year.
Some 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by buyers who do not live in Britain, driving up prices, making it difficult for the buyer to buy a property.
Many prosperous regions of the country, especially the capital, have become “ghost cities, ” as many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp cut to help more young people hold their first house.
He accused large construction companies of holding house prices high by buying land cheaply but not building it, and asked Mrs May to abolish quotas for affordable housing to end the UK housing miserable.
Mr Corbyn has announced a sharp series of proposed housing reforms, including lease controls and termination of debt-independent evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: ‘ Last year I said that I dedicate my premiership to the revival of the British dream – life should be better for every new generation.
And that means putting our broken housing market in order.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be right for foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom to buy homes just as easily as for hard-working British citizens.
For too many people, the dream is far from home, and the lack of homelessness remains all too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland. ”
Jack Ross, currently manager of Sunderland, says that his “ultimate goal ” is to become a Scottish manager at some point.
The club currently occupies the third place in the league and has three points behind the top.
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer, after returning St Mirren to the first Scottish league last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country. ”
I got a B-cap and that was' s', said Ross to BBC Scotland's sports record.
"But I have observed Scotland in Hampden often with my father as a child, and it is always something that brought me back.
"But this chance would only come if I were successful in the club management".
In front of Ross Dick Advantage, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio Manager of Sunderland.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he had no fear of participating in the footsteps of these established managers in such a big club.
"The success for me is currently defined by the question" Can I bring this association back to the Premier League? "
With its structure and facilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League, ” he said.
"To create it is not an easy task, but I would probably see myself as successful only if I can bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years in his management career, after a time as co-coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts' Coaching Personal.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third class, and arrested St. Mirren from the brink of relegation in the following season as master title.
Ross also says that during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academial he never felt as comfortable as now.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he remembered when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
"I really thought that the position as manager is right for me, more than that of a player.
This may seem strange because I have played well, achieved reasonable incomes and also had some highlights.
A player's life can be hard, however.
There are a lot of things you need to take part weekly.
I still experience stress and pressure, but I feel at home in management.
I always wanted to become a manager and now I can do it.
You can hear the full sports audio interview on Sunday 30 September, on Radio Scotland between 12: 00 and 13: 00 BST.
The perfect time for a beer is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday, a survey takes place.
The summer heatwave increased revenue for Britain ’ s embattled pubs, but increased pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pub- and bar-groups received a sales plus of 2.7 percent in July - but the income in restaurants sankenm 4.8 percent, so the figures.
Peter Martin, the Corporate Consulting (CGA), who compiled the figures, said: "sustained sunshine and England for longer than expected participation in the World Cup, meant that July followed a similar pattern as last month of June, when the Pub visits rose by 2.8%, only the restaurants were more affected.
The fall in the catering sector by 1.8% in June was exacerbated in July.
Most of the pubs and bars dominated by drinks, with Like-for-Like numbers rising more than the restaurants fell.
Even food dominated pubs suffered from the sun, though not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In administered pubs and bars, sales for drinks increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food fell by three percent. "
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the greatest factors when it comes to selling in the off-house market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to be under pressure, although a fall in sales of 4.8 percent over the previous year will be particularly painful, in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long hot summer could never have come worse for food operators, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide for the urgent break needed.
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide them from their parents.
According to a survey, every fifth child – some 11 years old – has hidden social media accounts that hide them from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students showed an increase in the “false Insta ” pages.
This news has heightened fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a main account to show it to their parents.
One fifth of the children - some only 11 years old - create social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students showed a rapid growth of “fake Insta ” accounts – a reference to photo sharing site Instagram.
This news has heightened fears that sexual content will be posted.
20 percent of the surveyed students said that they have a “partly ” main account for their parents and other private accounts.
A mother who stumbled over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a young man who called on others to “rape me. ”
The research of Digital Aware UK and the Headmasters and Headlines Conference (HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40% of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half of the people admitted to conducting private accounts.
The chairman of the Headmasters ’ and Headlines ’ Conference (HMC) Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that so many teenagers are subject to the temptation to create online spaces where you cannot be found by parents or teachers. ”
Eilat Doyle is sitting as the “voice of the athletes ” on the board of Scottish Athletics
Eilat Doyle was elected on board as a non-executive member at the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track singer and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead sport to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.

Thank you for the encouraging words! ”
Milk pump advertising, in which mothers are compared to cows, led to controversial online discussions.
A dairy pump company has caused controversial online discussions due to an ad comparing nursing mothers with melk-cows.
On the occasion of the launch of the allegedly "world's first silent and portable milk pump", the consumer electronics company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show which freedoms are offered by this new pump.
Four real mothers dance in a hayloft in the middle of cows to a number with the following lyrics: "Yes, I melt me, but you do not see a tail" and "If you have not noticed that it is not a Euter, it's my breasts".
The slogan goes on: "pump off, pump off, I feed babies, pump off, pump off, pump off, I melt my ladies."
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page provided online for controversy.
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say that it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to advertise this product with cows".
As we must also become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away within a few days after birth, "wrote a person.
The Elvie milk pump fits inconspicuously into a Still-H (Elvie / Mother).
Another commented: "understandably traumatic for mother and baby.
But why should we not use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?
Someone else added: "That is an outsider's statement."
Others defended advertising, including a woman who confessed that she found the song “original ”.
I think that is a great idea.
I would have got one if I had met yet.
I felt like a cow because of the pumps.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I took it as what it was.
This is a genital product, "wrote a person.
Another commented: "This is a funny advertising for mothers who pump off (often at their jobs or toilets) and feel like" cows ".
This is not an advertisement that praises or evaluates the milk industry '.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they have all danced in their BHs with the subtle pumps.
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and is fitted calmly into a Still-H, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out at pumps.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD commented to Mother: "The Elvie-Prize is such a revolutionary product that has earned a bold and provocative market launch.
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all its challenges while, in an entertaining and comparable manner, demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvie-library comes into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week a double mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly went into a camp on the Texas border.
The number of children imprisoned with a migrant background increased, though monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and fear that they risk being expelled when they are committed to a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their budgets would have to make fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority, signed in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Almost 80% of people who are either sponsors or budget members of sponsors are illegal here in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
"We keep track of these people," said Albence.
In an effort to speed up applications for children, officials introduced new rules that some of them require to appear in court within a month of their imprisonment, and not after 60 days of what was the previous standard, according to the people of accommodation.
Many will not appear personally, but via a video telephone conference to call for legal status at an immigration agent.
Those who do not qualify for discharge are quickly deported.
The longer children remain imprisoned, the more likely it is that they are scared or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escape.
Advocates said that these concerns are raised in a larger institution like Tornillo, where signs of fighting a child are more likely to be overlooked due to their size.
They added that the move of children into the city of tent without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or adopt themselves by friends could worsen a trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French, and Turkish “occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouvery also called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moule, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that, under the pretext of combating terrorism, foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, and “they will deal with it accordingly. ”
“You must withdraw unconditionally immediately, ” he said to the Assembly.
Moulant claimed that the “war on terror is almost over in Syria. ” More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011, and millions more have been driven out of their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and“ any illegal foreign presence forces. ”
The US has roughly 2,000 soldiers in Syria; they are mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France employs more than 1,000 floor soldiers in the war-torn country.
On the question of refugees, Mouth said that the conditions for return were in order, and he accused “some Western countries of irrational fears ” that caused refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return, ” says Moulvery.
“They politicize a strictly humanitarian question. ”
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that reconstruction aid for Syria could only be provided if a political agreement between Assad and the opposition were reached at an end to the war.
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib could advance political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russia ’ s supported Syrian troops on the province where three million people live.
But Moulé emphasized that the deal is “clear time limits. ” He hopes that the military operation will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al Qaeda, who will“ disappear..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moule called conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee: he said that the body ’ s work should be limited to “reviewing the articles from the current constitution, ” and warned of interference.
Why Trumpf wins a second term
With this logic, Mr Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many Liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment proceedings and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
That would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to a presidency of all times. ”
Now there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, the prime time ratings at CNN have doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has doubled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has average 2.4 million viewers in the main time, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, so Nielsen, and the MSC ’ s “Rachel Maddow Show ” exceeded the cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers in important news nights.
“This is a fire in which people are drawn, because it is not something we understand, ” said Neal Baer, the Showrunner of the ABC drama“ Designated Survivor ”, about a cabinet officer who will be president after an attack after the Capitol is destroyed.
Nell Scovell, a veteran of the comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts ”: And“ Few Hard Truth out of Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club ” has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said:" Because he makes me laugh, "Mrs Scout said to me.
The chaos is worth entertainment.
What is happening in Washington, of course, unlike anything else that can be seen on television, could influence the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Unleashed is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, if one is in the sixth hour of a debate, where a group of experts is discussing Bob Woodward ’ s use of “decent backcoat ” for his book“ Fear, ” Paul Manafort ’ s ostrich jacket for $15 000 (“a piece of arrogance, ” said the Washington Post) and the effects of Stormy Daniels ’ s astute descriptions of Donald Trump, former Anatomy, goes beyond what it means to be a informed citizen.
I will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"One part of what he does, that he feels like a reality show, is that he gives you something to eat every evening," said Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive of Wheelahouse Entertainment, and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the rotating occupations and daily actions of the Trump show (a fight with the NFL to praise Kim Jong-un).

When I reached Mr Fless this week, it was sunny 28 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was able to watch MSNBC recording CNN.
He could not pull himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who should stand up to the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court, which was in Sweden.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows at the time, and people said:" This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization, "Mr. Fleuss told me.

External money is flowing into the scariest races of the midterm elections to the House of Commons.
It is not surprising that, in the 17th century, Pennsylvania experienced a flood of cash, thanks to a realignment of Congress districts that reached the two incumbent in a race for the same seat.
For this new district in the suburb of Pittsburgh, the democrat Cong Lamb joins – who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another incumbent, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is decidedly overridden with the new 17.
The cards were re-shuffled, after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were illegally rigged in the Republican sense.
The race in the new 17th started a campaign campaign campaign campaign campaign campaign campaign campaign campaign campaign campaign campaign between the major political groups, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after he won a major victory in March in Pennsylvania for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been in Republican hands for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has won the district with 20 points ahead.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a slight lead.
U.S. Severe Impassification for El Salvador for support from China, then retreat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had left Beijing without too much protest from Washington.
Donald Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the partners presented the Trump Organization ’ s management team.
Representatives of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw US ambassadors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, given the “recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan, ” he gave Nauert, Foreign Ministry spokesman, a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which was estimated to receive $140 million in American aid in 2017, including narcotics controls, development, and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, such as cutting aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country of Central America with its high unemployment rate and high homicide rates.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, government officials made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending the examination of sanctions against El Salvador.
It is now envisaged that Vice-President Mike Pence will be addressing the conference to be held in mid-October in order to signal the importance the government attaches to the Assembly, the diplomats said.
And the US ’ s three diplomatic representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without new sharp statements or sanctions from Washington.
A speaker from the White House for Bolton did not comment on the details of the debate described by the three American representatives, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal consultations if their anonymity is respected.
Their reports were confirmed by an external government-sponsored analyst, who also looked on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next blow message could be the report by the Special Advisor Robert Mueller on Mr Trump ’ s possible obstruction of the judiciary, for which there is now very valid evidence in the public files.
Mr Mueller also applies his investigation to whether Trump ’ s election campaign with Russia triumphed in his attack on our elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Trump will have to be accountable to this body of affairs when he is preparing for the new election campaign, perhaps he will eventually have to answer to a court with his party friends.
These are a lot of ifs, and I do not want to say that Mr Trump ’ s fall is inevitable – nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are decisions that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic must take and will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were willing to staged a coup against Hitler if only the West resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to prevent the slaughter that followed for years.
History is about such turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy is being accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Justice Minister General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the publication of this paper, as this paper showed that last year he proposed to secretly record the president and speculating that he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein says that the Times report is wrong.
“How do we respond if the newly commissioned FBI missions on Brett Kavanaugh are not complete or objective – or if it is confirmed, despite credible accusations of sexual assault and deceit as Chief Justice?
Above all, will we, in the meantime, vote for a Congress that will hold Mr Trump to account?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will face difficult times.
But I do not believe that we will fail because I have learned a lesson in Prague.
My mother was Czechoslovak Jewish, deported from the same Nazi regime to Auschwitz, which was once occupied by my ambassador president.
She survived, emigrated to America and sent me to Sabbatkerze on the table with the swastika to fire.

Graham Dorrans of the Ranger is optimistic about the game with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are the hosts of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against Villarroal at the beginning of this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify for the European League.
A knee injury prevented middle field player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance in the season up to 2: 2 Undetermined against Villarsal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for larger things.
“This was a good point for us, because Villarroal is a skilled team, ” said the 31-year-old.
"We went into play in the belief that we can achieve something, and took a point along.
Perhaps we could have finished it, but everything in all was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were mobilized in the second half and were the better side.
A great European evening will be held on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but this will be a tough game because they have had a good result in their last game, but with the amount behind us, I am sure that we will make progress and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, between all that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a factor of well-being in this place.
The team is good, and the guys have really fun; the training is fine.
Hopefully, we can now put pressure behind us and succeed in the last season. ”
Women have sleepless nights because of this fear of retirement.
Although many respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few spoke with their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the survey of nation states agreed to discuss with their partner the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said that they were talking about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they are afraid of talking, ” said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Life Insurance Department of nation wide.
That is how you start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not give your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to maintain care, as these decisions can be an essential factor in determining costs.
Add to your financial adviser: Your Relationship Manager can also help you to find a way to pay this spending.
Financing opportunities for long-term care include traditional care insurance, hybrid capital-binding life insurance to cover this spending, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as you have the money for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, etc.
Work your legal documents: Put on legal struggles on your passport.
Take a precautionary approach and appoint a trustworthy person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the professional is in line with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
You may also consider a power of attorney for your assets.
To do this, you can choose a trustworthy person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your invoices are paid if you are unable to do so.

Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the authorities, at least 384 people were killed on Friday in a major earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu, and the number of deaths is expected to rise even further.
Communication has collapsed, so civil protection authorities have no access to information from the Donggala district, an area north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some essential facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Tengah, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Its population was estimated at 299,200 in 2017, an administrative area below the provincial level.
The people of Central Sulawesi mainly live on fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickelergbau is also important in the province, but is mainly operated in Morewali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also killed the Western Donggala in 1996 and nine people.
Indonesia is located on the shallow Pacific ring and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great beacons and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia ’ s province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra triggered a tsunami in 14 countries on December, killing more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of violent earthquakes took place in late March and early April at the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 occurred in the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and cost the 700 lives.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, a quake of 7.6 occurred.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 occurred on one of the Mentawai islands before Sumatra, causing a 10 meter high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
In 2016, a weak quake shook the PiS ’ s Jaya regency in Aceh and caused devastation and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people lost their lives through the collapsing buildings.
2018: Big quake shook Indonesia ’ s tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, especially on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists temporarily without homelessness.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence.
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and Deputy Director Sarah Palin, was arrested for bodily injury.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for alleged domestic violence, and a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest has already been published on Saturday by the Alaska State Trooperator.
When a female friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone away, according to the police report.
Palin was seized in trial at the Mat-Su Pretrial facility and is held with a $500 unsecured debt prescription, reports KUU.
He appeared on Saturday in court where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked what he was calling for, reported the network.
Palin is charged for three Class A offences, which means that he could be detained for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a crime against class B, which could be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that a penalty is reported against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence by interfering in the report on domestic violence and having a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had struck her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, after linking her son ’ s violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder originating from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia ’ s earthquake tsunami: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died on Friday after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have failed and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the central Sulawesi in the north-east of Indonesian capital Jakarta.
In social media media media, videos circulate showing the time of submitting.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a beach in the city of Pali when the tsunami blew land.
Federal prosecutors are calling for a rare death penalty for the terrorist attack in NYC suspects.
New York prosecutors demand the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people died – a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the federal state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot for his attack on a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he took pedestrians and cyclists ’ path.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov has “deliberately ” killed the eight victims and inflicted“ deliberately ” serious physical injuries, according to the Memorandum of Understanding to apply for the death penalty in the southern district of New York.
Both charges may be charged with death according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Saipov on 22 points, including eight charges for murder in connection with protection charge charge, typically used by federal lawyers in cases of organised crime, and a charge for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called 'substantial planning and prevention', the prosecutors said, described the way in which Saipov carried it as' despicable, cruel and perverted '.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has inflicted the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlié, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Paggno calamity, damage and loss, ” says the Memorandum of Understanding.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
For more than a decade, no case has been negotiated with capital punishment in the southern district of New York.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death sentence was carried out in New York in 1953 at Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, after the espionage of the Soviet Union was guilty for two years in the Cold War.
Both Rosenberger were executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the trials, the Uzbeke Saipov showed a shortcoming of repentance in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by videos from ISIS, which he addressed on his phone to the attack, so the indictment.
He demanded that the ISIS-flag be fitted in his hospital room, said the police.
He pleaded innocent for the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the Federal Department of Defense, who represents Saipov, said that he was obviously disappointed by the ruling of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a commitment to life in prison without release, the trauma of these events will only be prolonged for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov ’ s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be blamed for Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage swore to mobilise the 'People's Army' in a protest at the Tory conference today.
Former Ukip CEO said that politicians would have to feel the heat of the eurosceptics; one of Theresa May ’ s Members suggested that he should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
The conservative backbenches Peter Bone said the march in Birmingham, Britain would be 'out now' if Mr Farage were Minister of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided ranks was underscored by the pro-Remain-Tories, which are launching a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
For Prime Minister, it is problematic to keep track of their Chequers compromise plan in the midst of the attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers, and the EU.
The allies insisted that, despite the backlash, they will push ahead with an attempt to conclude an agreement with Brussels – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their package and the 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told Leve Mean Leave that he wanted "chuck Chequers".
He proposed to make Mr Farage the same and let him take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out long ago," he said.
The Member for Wellington added: 'I will stand up for Brexit, but we must' chuck Chequers'.
He represented his opposition to the EU and said: we did not have world wars to show us dimly.
We want to make our own laws in our own country '.
Mr Bono rejected proposals that have changed public opinion since the vote in 2016: 'The idea that the British people have changed and want to remain is completely untrue'.
Andrea Jenkyn, the Tory party ’ s Brexit envoy, also participated in the demo, saying to the reporter: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and our activists who demonstrate the streets and secured our victory.
Please drop the Checkers proposal and listen.
In an acute communication to Mrs May she added: Prime Minister keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Mr Farage said at the campaign event that politicians should be brought to 'feel the heat' if they were to betray the 2016 referendum decision.
"It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them: 'We will not let you get away with it'.
In a message to the excited crowd he added: "I want you to let our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel this heat.
We are mobilising the country ’ s popular army, with which we won Brexit and which will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.
Before a two-hour rally in the city centre, the Remainers marched through Birmingham.
A crowd of activists waved Tories against Brexit banners after the group was formed this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a Labour man, mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party note when the conference was opened.
These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and the whole technology for Canada and, thanks to smooth border controls and unlimited free trade in Ireland, he added.
It is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, "he added.
Warren is planning a 'serious look' for a presidential candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will look for a presidential candidacy.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke on Saturday at a Town Hall meeting in the West of the Federal State about their future.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running re-election in November against the Palestinian State Representative, Geoff Diehl, who was Co-chairman of Trump ’ s campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been speculating for a long time about whether he wants to be the opponent of Trump in the 2020 elections.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday evening was its 36th Town Hall meeting with voters, since Trump was sitting in the White House.
A participant asked her whether she wanted to run for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to put our broken government in order, including a woman at the top.

The police in Baton Rouge, La, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday about the death of the LSU-chain operator Wayne Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Authority announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20) at 11 a.m.
They published a video of shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was seen in film.
Sims, 20, was shot near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayne Sims suffered a shot on his head and died of the consequences," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday about 247 sport the media.

Great Prize of Russia: Lewis Hamilton joins the World Cup title after team order forces him to win Sebastian Vettel.
It became clear at the moment that Valtterti Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' Team Order would play a major role in the race.
Botta had a good start from pole position and almost abandoned Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team fellow.
Vettel started to go to the box and left Hamilton to train at the end of the conversation, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes sailed a round later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove off after a wheel wheel drive, in which the Ferrari driver willingly left the inside free, in danger of going to a double train to defend himself in the third bend.
Max Trappen started from the back row of the starter field and was on his 21st birthday screener at the end of the first round.
He then performed a large part of the race and stuck in his tyres to reach the target as soon as possible and to overtake Kimi Räikkönen as four times.
He finally entered the box in the 44th round, but could not increase his speed in the remaining eight laps while Räikkönen became fourth.
It is a difficult day because Valtterti did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who left me behind.
The team did such an exceptional job to secure the seats one and two, "said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diannene Feinstein at a Saturday rally to hold back the letter in which Christine Blasey Ford accused the Supreme Court nominee of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the statement made by Ford before the Senate ’ s Justice Committee, but commented that events in the Senate showed that people were "in common and false".
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the Senate in the last few days when you see anger when you see people who are angry and in common and in common, and evil and dishonest," he said.
“If you look at publications and leads, and then say,“ Oh, I did not.
I did not. '
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you have something happened?
Remember your answer.... did you let the document wander through - "oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not worked. ”
Well, I am waiting for one minute.
If we did so... No, we did not act, ” he added, in the imitation of the senator.
Finestein received a letter from Ford with accusations to Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked back in September - but it was fine that her office was not.
"I have [...] not hidden Ford's claims that I have not lived their history," told Finestein the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it as she wanted."
But their rejection did not come well with the President, who said at the rally Saturday night: I tell you what was really bad body language.
Perhaps she did not, but that was the worst body language I have ever seen. '
The President, who continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate who was accused of three women ’ s sexual misbehavior, indicated that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to reclaim power by all means necessary.
They see the evil, the commonness, they do not care who they hurt, whom they must create out to gain power and control, "reported Mediaite of the president's address.

Flight controllers die to ensure that hundreds of aircraft can escape the earthquake.
An air raid in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after his death because he ensured that an aircraft with hundreds of people could safely land on the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a serious earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plagued the area and many are caught in ruins in the city of Palu.
His colleagues ran for their lives, but the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawaan Agung refused to leave his post in the extremely unstable control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that the Flight Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to start safely.
He then jumped from the transport control tower when he thought that it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
The speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision saved well hundreds of lives, reported ABC News in Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the Pali helicopter arrived.
"We were profoundly shaken when we heard of it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll could go to thousands, with the country ’ s Civil Protection Authority saying that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
“It is assumed that the number will rise even further, as many bodies were still in ruins, and many could not be achieved, ” said Minister Sutopo Purwo Nubigho.
Up to six metres devastated high waves have Palu, where a mass funeral is taking place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and stocks.
Risa Kubsuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute brings a ambulance in.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are plundered everywhere ".
Jan Gelfound, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN said, "The Indonesian Red Cross is working tirelessly to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.

Are you ready? "reported CNN.
This year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia crashes: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after a crash in the lagoon.
The airline of the airline, which crashed into a Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now suggests that a man is missing after she had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members would have safely left the declining aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a publication that from Saturday afternoon it was not possible to take responsibility for a male passenger.
The airline shared, worked with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further information on passengers, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped to save other passengers and crew after the aircraft reached the water when they tried to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The officials said on Friday that seven people were brought to a hospital.
The airline announced that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the crash remains unclear, as is the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy shared that the aircraft landed in the lagoon just before the landing.
Witnesses want to have observed that the plane is off the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the aircraft flew very low.
“This is a really good thing, ” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through clogged water to the emergency exits of the declining aircraft.
He reported that the cabin crews were panicking and shouted, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The US Navy reported that seafarers working close to improving a landing helped save by using a inflatable boat to bring people to land before the aircraft sank in about 30 metres.
Data on the air safety network indicate that over the last two decades, 111 people have died in the event of crashes of airline carriers registered with PNG, but none of them affected by Air Niugini.
An analyst reconstructed the timeline of the night in which a woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the Public Prosecutor closed the evidence in a man's retrial, accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in life in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, Analyst of the US Department of Justice, has spent several hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He outlined for the jury how he conjured up the movements of the 29 year old accused, Quinton Tell, and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers in the night of their death by mobile recordings.
Rowlett said he received site data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
In response, Sanford was interrogated by the police.
Sanford said on Saturday and said that he was not in the city on that day.
When asked by prosecutors whether Tell was spending the night in Sanford ’ s truck, he replied that he lied because his truck was in Nashville at that time.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
According to mobile records, they only knew themselves for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis delete text messages, call and contact information from his phone after Cham's death.
“He has deleted it from his life, ” said Hale.
Defense begins on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he would expect the procedure to go to the jury at a later stage.

One more black person?!
New Yorkers ’ nannies sued couple because they were silenced according to "racist" text.
A child girl from New York sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a letter not sent to her by the mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denies that she is racist and holds the complaint for 'blackmail'.
Lynsey Plasso-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was dismayed after she found that her new child care, Giselle Maurice, was black when she took up her first working day in 2016.
Mrs Plasso-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a short message: "Neiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
However, rather than sending him to her husband, she sent him twice to Ms Maurice.
After having noticed her Patzer, a "uncomfortable Emer" Plasso-Flaxman Miss Maurice and explained that her outgoing child girl, who was Afro-American, has done a bad job and that she wants to stop a Filipino instead, says the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her work on a day and sent home for a translation.
Now Maurice sued the couple for compensation for the dismissal, demanding compensation of $350 per day for the six-month full-time employment for which she had originally been suspended, albeit without a contract.
"I will show them, look at them, do not do so," she told the post on Friday and added: "I know that discrimination is."
The couple resisted the claims, saying that the decision to stop Maurits working relationship was reasonable and that they acted for fear because they could not trust them after they insulted them.
"My wife had sent her something which she did not want to say.
It is not racist.
“We are not racists, ” her husband Joel Plasso of the Post.
“Would you entrust your children to someone you, albeit by mistake, have offended?
Your newborn baby?
Hardly. ”
Plasco said that his wife was pregnant in the seventh month and not in the best constitution, and called the complaint “blackmail. ”
"You want to attack someone?"
That is not a very nice thing, adds to investment bankers.
During the dispute, the public quickly convicted the couple in the social media and attacked them for their behaviour and their way of thinking.
Padington publishers feared that readers could not identify with a speaking bear, which revealed a new letter.
Bonds ’ daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said about the letter: It is difficult to get someone to read it for the first time before publication.
“It ’ s very funny – now that we know about Paddingtons ’ great success. ”
She said that her father, who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman, was inspired to write a children ’ s book by a small toy bear, would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected, and she added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication after his death last year was “bittersü<unk> ”.
To Paddington, which she calls “a very important family member, ” she still says that her father was proud of his ultimate success in his silence.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he was not a boyant person," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if you had a child that did something: you are proud of the child, although it is not really your act.
I think he has seen Padingtons ’ success a bit like that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always paid tribute to Paddington himself. ”
My daughter died and I had to leave on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was brought to the hospital of Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad has called regularly to say that it was really bad that she probably did not manage it", Ms Ednann-Laperouse said.
Then I got the call from Nad in which she said that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to leave her.
And I did.
I said: “Tashi, I love you so much, treasure.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you. ”
The medicine that the oorms had given her to pump her heart further slowly left her body.
She had died some time before and that brought everything to a halt.
I just had to sit there and wait knowing what happens.
I could not shout or shout because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together.
After all, Ms Ednagen-Laperouse, grieved about the loss of her daughter, on board the plane with the other passengers who did not foresee any of the pain she underwent.
“No one knew something, ” she said.
"I had lowered my head and all the time fell tears.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved it. ”
Maligning women design postcards on the prevention of suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost a loved one by suicide want to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring news and telephone numbers that people can call if you need help.
Ms. Davis ’ s son Tyler was 13 years old when he was suffering from depression and, at the age of 18, he got around.
“I want no parent to feel as I do every day, ” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and from LySidney, described her son as a promising cook with contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said, his smile lit every room. ”
But he had abandoned his job before his death because he “went very badly. ”
In 2014, Tyler, who was then eleven years old, found his brother after he had taken his life.
Mrs Davis said: ‘ I am constantly concerned that this could have a domino effect. ’
Mrs Davis made the cards, “to let people know that there is someone with whom they can talk, even if it is only a friend. ”
Sit not still around - you have to talk. "
Mrs Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms Davies for years, lost her life's toxic Mark with which she was 15 years old, shortly before his mother died.
“He did not tell me that he feels bad or depressed, ” she said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his mind.
He was destroyed on the ground on Christmas Day - when the children had opened their presents he had not had any eye contact with them or anything else made. "
She said that his death was a great trauma for them and they would now have to perform a funeral work.
It is our fault.
But we must all continue and fight. ”

FBI missions have begun, and Brett Kavanath ’ s future is at stake.
“I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for - an investigation that is time and scope limited - we could perhaps achieve a bit of unity, ” Mr Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee falls“ apart amidst a deeply rooted party political deadlock. ”
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to be established?
Their restraint is simply due to the timing.
Until the mid-term elections, it is only five weeks, on 6 November, when the Republicans are performing badly as expected, they will be greatly weakened in the attempt to move forward the man elected to the country ’ s highest court.
George W. Bush contacted senators to persuade them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the release of the FBI report?
The Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will vote.
It is still unclear whether Brett Kavanaugh can win at least 50 Senate votes, with Vice President Mike Pence deciding on equal votes and confirming Kavanugh ’ s seat in Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea ’ s Republican minions has fallen under Kim
North Korea ’ s cross-country runners have fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean MEP.
According to data from the Ministry of South unification, Park Byeong-Nachg provided that there were 1,127 of stewards last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in prices for people smugglers play an essential role in this.
Pyongyang has not been made public.
After all, the majority of North Korea ’ s poultry imports receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing from China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.
China sees outsiders as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are formally still in war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang on talks about the stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed on the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea ’ s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US for the lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the US, our national security is at stake, and in these circumstances, unilateral disarmament is not possible in the first step, ” Ri stated in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi ’ s board is called Kavanaugh a hysterical and says that he is unsuitable for the Supreme Court ’ s service.
The leader of the democratic minority group, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for a seat at the Supreme Court “hysterisch ”, and said that he was unable to serve the Supreme Court in temper.
Pelosi made the comments at an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival at Austin, Texas.
“I could not think other than that if a woman had ever behave like this, they would have called it“ hysterical ”, Pelosi said about her response to Kavanath ’ s statement before the Senate ’ s verdict on Thursday.
Kavanaugh disproved the claims that he had attacked Dr. sexually, Christine Blasey Ford, when they were both young people.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he shouted almost and fought with tears when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him a “bizarre and coordinated call murder campaign ” organised by liberals who are angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanath ’ s statement proved that he could not serve before the Supreme Court because he showed that he was prejudiced against democrats.
“I believe that he himself disqualifying with such statements and the way in which he can be influenced by the Clinton and Democrats, ” she said.
When asked whether, in the event of his confirmation and a democratic majority in the House, she would seek an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh, Pelosi hesitated.
“I want to say the following: if he says the truth to neither Congress nor the FBI, he is not only unsuitable for the High Court service, but also for the service to the court at which he is currently engaged, ” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a district judge in D.C. Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that she, as a democrat, was concerned about possible Kavanallowing sentences against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v., as he stands for conservative justice.
In his closing remarks, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to the court and expect us to say,“ Is this not wonderful, ” said Pelosi.
And women must support it.
It is a veritable heckling speech, months and years full of anger, and it cannot get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I do not think that this is unusual, or?"
She continued: “I once helped a woman, in the executive, who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique in which she always started to cry when she was angry and started to cry, to the person with whom she spoke said:“ You may think that I am sad because I am crying.
I am angry '.
And then she just went on.
And I thought that was brilliant. ”
tears are allowed as valve for anger because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of an early job in an office dominated by men, in which I once weaned with indescribable anger, was that I am being wrapped up by an older woman, an intellectual manager before which I was always scared - who dragged me into a staircase.
"Let them never see you weep," she told me.
"You do not know that you are furious.
They think you are sad and happy because they have caught you. "
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, supported Gary Hart in his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, he was known that Mr. Hart had an extramarital affair on board a boat called “Monkey Business ”, but he was out of the race.
“It was not a well-conceived decision, ” she told me with a laughter of 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snow White and the seven Dwarves".
Because the campaign was already underway for a long time, it was delayed by raising funds, and so she swore that she would not participate in the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She noted that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her just $250.
“Think that, I get forward lorberries? ” she was wonderful.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and raise voters rather than delegate, and anger about sexism - that she was stifled.
“One might think I had a nervous breakdown, ” Schroeder remembers how the press reacted to it.
"One would have thought that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember having thought about what they would write to my tombstone.
"Does it cry?"
How the trade war between China and the US might be beneficial to Beijing
The opening salves of the US-China trade war have been deafening, and an end to the conflict is not in sight. A divide between the two countries can be beneficial in Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning early this year by taxing important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The introduction of new tariffs on imported Chinese products worth $200 billion (GBP 150 billion) this week has led to a dramatic escalation of the situation.
Beijing has revanched itself every time in the form of material benefits, and most recently, tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China answers every blow from the US with a response, and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second-largest economy will fall in the near future.
Putting Washington in charge means yielding to the demands that it publicly bow to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But if Beijing uses its opportunities correctly, the trade war with the US can have a positive long-term impact on China by reducing the mutual dependencies of the two economies, say experts.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers had previously assumed, ” said Abigail Grace, a scientific collaborator at the Center for New American Security, a think tank focusing on Asia.
Syria is ready to return refugees, "says Foreign Minister
Syria says that it is willing to return refugees voluntarily and calls for assistance in rebuilding the country that was ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Mousé said at the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure," he said.
The government continues to clean down areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mouse said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he emphasized that he would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe Winning the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup in 2018 against Team USA with a final result of 16.5 points in the Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on European soil and since 1993 has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe.
Europe regained the crown, because the Danish team of Captain Thomas Björn scored 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with most of the tournament, landed with the ball in the water on the 16th hole in the Par-3 and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has made his rounds and has become one of four players ever since the beginning of the tournament in 1979.
The American Jordan Spith was beaten 5 & 4 by the lowest ranked players in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, a world-class player, lost 2 and 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who might last resort to the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has already taken part in eight Ryder Cups, is the most successful European ever in this tournament with 25.5 career points.
“I do not normally cry, but today I can ’ t be different.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for accepting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It is about the team., and I am glad that I could help, ” said an emotional Garcia after the victory of Europeans.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who beaten the US champion Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The 23-year-old Rahm said," The incredible pride I feel to have defeated Tiger Woods when I grew up admiring this guy.
As a result, Woods lost all four games in France and his career balance of the Ryder Cup is 13-21.
An unusual statistic for one of the largest players of all times, who won 14 great titles alongside Jack Nicklaus.
The team USA tried to buy flights for the team, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the golf tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk says his team ’ s disappointing performance: “I am proud of the team, they have fought.
This morning we had time to put pressure on Europe.
We have massaged it.
hat off before Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All its 12 players have played well.
We will rearrange the team, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder-Cutter committee and we will continue to develop.
I love them and I am proud to train them.
You have to pull your hat.
We were taken over. ”
New to the algae: concentrations in Pinella, Manacorte and Sarasota take off.
The recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in the red floods concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay Area.
According to FWC, in Pinellas, Managua, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier only reported partially algaen stains – this indicates a decrease in concentrations.
The Red Tower is situated 200 kilometres from the northern Pinellas to the southern provinces.
Spot is about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but less than a week ago.
Algeciras was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations were reported on the coast and open seas in Pinellas County, low to high levels at open sea in Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Mantee County, high concentrations in coastal and open seas in Sarsota County, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high shore and high sea levels in Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In addition to this, it is also possible to register the studies in the area of Pinellas, Managua, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
It was not reported last week from northwest Florida.
