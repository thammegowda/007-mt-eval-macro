NSA affair highlights total absence of intelligence debate
How do you explain the contradictoire attitude of the French government, which on one hand is offusquant in public when convoquant the US ambassador on October 21, and on the other bans overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of speculation about Edward Edward lecturne?
To me, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande phone Barack Obama or when Foreign Secretary Laurent Fabius convoes the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the scale of US surveillance on the entire communications in France.
Isn't it surprising to read in the Times' pages just weeks apart of one side's reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondance and of another a condamnation of the Quai d' Orsay's écoutes by the NSA?
Would would there be such a vague hypocrisie on your part?
The journalistic move is not moral positioning, but the search for the interest and pertinence of information that help every citizen build an opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the voile on the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we in the past consider that, given American power, this provides important éclairage.
When we describe American interception systems at the expense of French diplomacy in the US, this is in no way to outrage us about this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information supplied by the NSA regarding terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Can you miss American collaboration?
The development for years of highly powerful technological interception tools by the US, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Of course, in this regard, France and the US have included rules of cooperation and contact information and are described back and forth as vital.
As an example, Mohammed must have seen Mohammed in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the resources of the NSA.
France can be led, by example, to transmit entire blocks of data about the Atlantic region to American services, and, in return - we've already quickly said so - Americans can give information to the French about other parts of the world.
So the core issue behind this NSA affair is not so much the ability or right of countries to build interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly within the Parlements, about justification for such systems, the scope that must be the their, and, in the end, the issue of atteintes to freedoms.
What are the US actually causing? a deterioration in their image?
You've got to condemn them, I don't see how they'll be able to be punished.
The risk run by Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and it has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest peak of their state, have been monitored.
That is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the US have been strained.
A other effect can be more economic: More European or South American companies are rechrising, based on revelations, to hand over their confidential data to US prestataires subject to US laws, and therefore to the reach of the NSA.
Last element: The broad movement of revelations engaged by world media, which is helping to enclench a debate over intelligence surveillance practices until then practically unheard of, could push législators, including American, to revisit the powers they gave to their intelligence services.
Barack Obama meets Iraqi prime minister, in amid soaring violence
The US president was due to receive on Friday November 1, 2013 Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, in search of help from the United Arab Emirates to fight the biggest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq saw in October its deadliest month in five years and a half, according to figures released Friday, November 1 by Iraqi officials.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1 600 people were wounded.
The U.N. gives a even higher toll with 979 deaths and 1 902 wounded.
Those violence is increasingly deadly in the face of increased security measures and major military operations launched for months by Nouri Al Maliki's government, dominated by Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1 073 people had been killed.
Two years ago roughly after the U.S. troop withdrawal, the level of violence is making for another embrasement as neighboring Syria is in the grip of a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funeral services.
Men are shot in the middle of the street or even home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent among the Sunni minority, at power under Saddam Hussein, which is complaining of being marginalized politically and being the target of inhuman arrests, has encouraged this flambée of violence.
Friday, fresh violence killed four people in northern Iraq, on the heels of the deaths of at least 26 people in a string of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
A good part of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated to al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "global war" against al-Qaeda.
The violence is at the center of talks in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki who will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting on Dec. 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end military engagement in this country, had painted an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplié meetings with the executive, and Congress leaders.
Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased U.S. assistance in security is backed by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But those also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing him partial responsibility for the recovery of violence by his "secularist and authoritarian" politics.
They also demanded from Barack Obama that he make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "Iran's pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
French police will stop fans of Anderlecht coming autrement than with RSCA cars
French police have decided to set strict rules regarding the Royal Sporting Club's Anderlecht game against Paris Saint-Germain set for Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman for the Bruxelles-area police force, said on Friday.
RSCA supporters who will want to travel to this Champions League match will have to obligatoirement use the travelling system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman passed on.
The déroulement will be the same for the return.
"While other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris through other means, the French police force did say that measures were taken allowing to carry out arrests or armed guards," Marie Verbeke said further.
Vatican sonde on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has begun conducting a major survey worldwide on how paroisses handle sensitive issues like contraception, divorce and trained couples of people of similar sex.
The poll asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat the men and women who live together without being united by the liens of marriage.
The poll was sent out at the mi-octobre to every national bishops conference, with the consigne to get the most answers possible.
The information will serve at a major gathering on the family that Pope Benedict expects to host next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the "National Catholic Reporter," an independent Catholic journal in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the United States Conference of Catholic bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how appropriate to survey paroissiens.
In Britain, bishops posted the poll on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
The 33-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six charges, according to the National Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was charged with taking advantage of the hostages, séquestration, profiting threats, carrying a weapon in a dangerous despicable manner, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The quick reactions of the officers involved and their ability to désamorcer the situation immediately were critical to the safe conclusion of this incident," Cpl. Bert Paquet said through a spokesman.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will have to appear in court Friday.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may scrap smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could scrap the pleasure you take smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence.
More other tests are needed before starting trials on the human being, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccinal strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausted all the methods now available on the market, but discover that their addiction is enough to overcome these different approaches," Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains an unacting virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine anticorps.
The virus infects in a slit fashion cells in the liver, which then begins to produce a regular flow of anticorps.
The anticorps hunt down all nicotine molecules found in the blood vessels and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which keeps the fumeur from having his dose of nicotine.
In the tests, the vacciné mice to whom we later gave nicotine continued their activity normally.
But mice who hadn't been vaccinated "were calming," the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
previous previous vaccines against tobacco have proved uneffective because they contained anticorps.
The injections were to be repeated so commonly to ensure levels of anticorps remain high that they were too expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be far lower because it turns liver cells into anticorps factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine to be totally safe, one could administate it to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely it will be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
"They will know that if they restart smoking they will take no pleasure because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this will help them lose their bad habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that far more extensive research was needed.
Egyptian Islamists in the street to protest Morsi trial
colère gronde in Egyptian Islamic ranks.
Two days before the opening of the trial of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, they rose to the streets.
A mobilisation across Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first démocratiquement elected president.
This is a trial noted by this militant from the Muslim Brotherhood.
Until now no lawyer has been able to meet him and no voluntary could take a copy of the documents.
This is a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial is furious at a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to get Sisi to rule, not the opposite.
Morsi is to sentence Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, Nahda massacres, and the mass killings of the Républicaine National Guard.
Sisi is a mentalist and a traître.
clashes clashes in Alexandrie, police made use of tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
Monday, 20 police will be deployed outside Cairo's police academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be sentenced.
Foreign case detected in cat in Val-d' Oise
Officials said Thursday 31 October that a case of rage had been detected in a chateau in the Val-d' Oise, apparently of foreign origin as France has been indemne from indigenous cases since 2001.
The chateau was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and he died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rage was confirmed by Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been launched so that people may have come into contact with this chateau between October 8 and 28," the health and agriculture departments say.
"Five people with contact with the chateau have already been identified" and have received préventive treatment.
"In the man, the préventive treatment of human rage, administered after contact with the porteur animal, but before the apparition of symptoms, is very effective," the statement says.
The at present call on people who may have been morbid, griffon, egregious or layed on a mug or on a skin léché by this chateau or whose animal may have been in contact with that chateau between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.095 between 10 and 18 November.
"France UK being indemne from rage since 2001, this chateau or mother have been imported from another country, not indemne," the statement said.
The Department of Agriculture says the last "indigenous" case of rage reported was December 1998 on a renal and that "the UK was declared officially indemne from this disease in November 2001 by the International Organisation for épizooties (OIE)."
A case of rage on a dog imported illegally from Gambia had been reported in 2008.
"The is a deadly disease if it is not treated at all," the ministries point out and it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the apparition of the disease's first symptoms.
Council portique at Pont-de-Buis disused
PonPont-de-Buis bridge, around which a violent protest Saturday was held, was disarmed Thursday morning.
grgrues arrived on scene shortly after 10 p.m., and traffic on the national side was discontinuing in the process.
The decision for the démantèlement, announced by the préfecture of Finistère Wednesday, was taken by the Ecomouv Company, the porous operator of the portique.
It is the latest of three bridge bridge portiques in the UK, with the other two being disused or sabotaged.
Australian Australian faces jail term in Thailand
A 22-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, has appealed the ruling and has been put on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a State Court in Phuket on June 15 of false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who were controlling her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, CCTV tapes later revealed she had returned to her hotel in due course after splitting from her Australian little friend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted invented the story of all parts.
She was held in a local jail cell ahead of the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention center in the périphérie of Phuket rather than a prison for women.
It is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who made it to Canberra's Foreign Office to help his daughter.
Tunks told The Sunday Telegraph of Sydney that much of the family was "extremely concerned" about the welfare of her daughter and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We obviously have experienced an frightening time, but we hope to bring her home in any time soon," Tunks said.
Bamford made the ruling and was put on bail after the payment of a 50,000 baht bail.
In Australia, the press said that in order to help, she was on holiday in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai legal sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned the appeal could lead to a alourment of the sentence pouvant range to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in a adult prison.
Still, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand may also seek to redorer its deteriorating image with tourists, which could lead to an acquitted.
Google, Samsung and Huawei face legal action involving Nortel patents
The company that owns thousands of old Nortel patents began an avalanche of patent lawsuits Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, particularly Google, the company it coiffed to the poteau in the auction of the patents that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $5.5 Md, filed suit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violation before the U.S. Court of Appeals in Texas.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow advertising in relation to Internet search terms, the trial's findings said, which is Google's core business.
It was not immediately possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run under Google's Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its bid repeatedly, to eventually offer $4.1 Md.
After losing the Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google acquired by the time Motorola Mobility for a reported $12.5 Md, a market in part based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although having failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question at the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate lese-brand patents," the trial findings said.
Rockstar is seeking larger damages at Google, because it claims Google's patent violation is obstinément true, the plaintiff said.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labor minister of Nouvelle-Wales Joe Tripodi will face an investigation by the state anti-corruption regulator.
Former South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the commercial bait policy at the behest of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the area controlled by the government.
Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out whether Mr. Obeid had made it difficult for several state ministers to renew his bickering in Circular Quay, where the Obeid possède two restaurants and a café, after their expiration in August 2005, without there being an appeal.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr Tripodi's former deputy general secretary, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
Over the years of talks began in 2005, the government made it difficult for the bales to make it to the public.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the band-conditions involving Circular Quay companies, which brought the Obeid about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without there being an appeal.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister for Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was at first opposed to the tender.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid who, Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, demanded a change in government policy in bailing out the bait.
The transcription of phone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls passés in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under M Obeid at the Department of Pê& Eeries.
"The issue debated over these phone conversations was the making of policy relating to commercial bait?" Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we talked about but in any case it wasn't about that.
In any case certainly not between me and Mr Obeid.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets aboard planes (but not pass an call with their mobile phone)
passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their mobile phone - in accordance with the highly anticipated new directives released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from one airline to the next, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said in a news conference.
Airlines airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their planes meet the new directives and that they have put out the crew training tools and rules regarding rankcraft to be in compliance.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines aimed at expanding the use of electronic devices on their planes.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"In order to approve the plan, we may approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must éteint their smartphones, computers and other devices as soon as the plane's doors are closed.
They are not supposed to rallumed them until the plane reaches a 10,000 feet altitude and the commander gives his approval.
Passengers are supposed to light up their aircraft during the plane's descente before landing and not to rallumed them until the plane has landed.
In accordance with the new directives, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interférences will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during décollages, atterrissages and rotation over the ground, the FAA said.
Most new planes and other planes that have been modified so passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should satisfy the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, was pleased with these changes.
"Once the new policy is put in place in any way - and we will work in close collaboration with the carriers for that - it will be profitable to everyone," Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room surveillants" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be illegal to connect to the Internet to surfer, trade emails and SMS or download data in excess of 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, laptops and other devices in the plane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble style game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his mobile phone in 2011 when he was deported to great fanfare from an American Airlines plane after refusing to extinguish his device as the aircraft was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptop computers will always have to be ransacked because they could injuring someone if they fly around the cabine.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
regulatory regulatory power regarding mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAA.
FAA can lift ban on some electronic devices during décollage and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered to pose a risk.
"Mobile phones are truly a problem, not only because they could possibly create interférences with navigation instruments, but because we know, of course, that they could disrupt mobile phone antennas if they are used on board," Rosenker said.
A industrial advisory panel created by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure pesant on the FAA has grown over the past few years to relax restrictions regarding their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid safety reason for these interdictions.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least a third of passengers forget to light up their devices, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports about the presence of interférences with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget of then.
The new planes depend much more on electric systems than previous generations of planes, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interférences and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified planes to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also survive better than interférences.
The vast majority of the air traffic planes should allow wider use of electronic devices in accordance with the new directives, Huerta said.
Today electronic devices in today's home are émettant far lower power transmissions than previous generations of devices.
électroniques readers, by contrast, only emulate minimally sound transmissions when you turn a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for an easing of restrictions regarding the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's executives packed a ligne of Kindle electronic books and made it fly to see if there were problems, but there were none.
This inspired members of the FAA's advisory committee mixed feelings as to whether the use of the devices present or not a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interférences from the devices were real, even though the risk was minime.
Other other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports coming from pilots that indicate the aircraft can intersect with a plane's systems, and most of them are very old.
Still, the panel recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to dim their aircraft during atterrissages to instruments in low-visibility conditions.
A travel industry group was critical of the changes, calling them full arrangements for travelers equipped with technologies.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
rules relating to the use of electronic devices on board remain for now in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to light up their planes and smartphones during décollage and landing despite the U.S. move aimed at easing regulation relating to electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases as long as they are in "airplane mode."
Passengers can already do so for the most part of the flight, but many people find it pénible not being able to access their electronic books during the landing and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that requires US carriers to perform a significant job in order to meet the requirements, but have said they have no intention in the immédiat of changing their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but said restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"CASCASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in the plane," it said.
The issue is the subject of regulation that requires awe-Sciences operators to guarantee safety while on the job and passengers to respect safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about its intention to expand use of its on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said it would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think that would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes," a spokesman said.
Qantas said it was for the time being following current rules.
"Conformément to our current policy, electronic devices can't be used during décollage and landing, and we have no intention in the immédiat of changing that," she said.
The FAA's decision applies to U.S. airlines.
Still, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will closely consider the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and depend on the age of their fleet.
The carriers will have to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interférences from electronic devices, as well as review the textbooks, training equipment, airport baggage transportation programs and instructions provided to passengers.
"As an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as laptops, electronic book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to dim their aircraft during the landing.
The company also recommended that heavier aircraft be ranched in any place under seats or in upper compartiments during décollage and landing.
CDC releases tips on allergies in child to schools
Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of directives indicating how to handle children's food allergies at school.
It is the first set of direct-to-consumer lines the U.S. government releases, although the number of children in school age with food allergies has risen sharply.
One child in 20 in the U.S. now suffers from food allergie.
The CDC discovered that the prevalence of food allergies in the child had increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information aimed at schools on how to educate the professory-level and staff about food allergies in the child, and how to treat them in case of an allergen reaction.
He also recommends schools have a stock of épinéphrine - the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used - to be able to respond quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The state's legislative assemblées recently updated regulations to allow schools to more easily have épinéphrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typing symptoms released by children who have an allergique reaction.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something is pique me the langue," "I have the impression of having a cheveu on the langue" or "I have picotons on the langue."
Much opposition to assisted suicide in House of Representatives
The Canadian mond Care Congress, which is this week in Ottawa, comes days after the vote in favor of the principle of the proposed medical marijuana bill in the United States.
It's the opportunity for several nursing homes to réaffirmer their disagreement.
While all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their lives, according to a spokeswoman for the American Hospital Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If you put the emphasis on relays in the United States, the approach to euthanasie would become minime.
The president of the National Care Association also rejects the proposed medical care bill.
If it is adopted, Alberte Déry worries about the consequences on future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she déplore-t-elle.
The majority of nursing homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Alliance of Care providers, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie House in Gatineau, says the service would be of no use.
We never ask, "I want to die, give me an injection. '
The Association of Care providers, Rick Firth, believes the New England Bill dissatisfaction with the public over the vocation of palliatifs care.
He does not believe Ontario will follow suit.
On her part, the Liberal Democrat Democrat, Stéphanie Vallée, says the notion of end use will have to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a little kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go out late and dress up to go to the neighbors.
Right I've become more pingy.
In past two years I haven't distributed one bona fide and I certainly won't do more this year.
But the statistics show I'm the breastfeeding breastfeeding when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - celebrate Halloween this year, unspending a total of $6,9 Md in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I expect with impatience at every Halloween party are trends.
The déguisements are expected to total $1.1 Md out of the 6,9 billion spent, according to NRF.
This year, sexy unlocked items are making fureur.
Women have no longer to be sexy professionnelles; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers and carottes.
For what it's like, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I parse that Daft Punk's space men will feature among our Instagram photos this year.
To Google, the most wanted dressed dressed up are zombies, Batman, pirates and sorcières.
I suppose there's no problem staying traditional.
We déguised our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on costume cards for animals this year, the NRF said.
It makes a lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, you don't gladly glue.
Americans will spend $1.8 Md in candy this year, according to Nielsen's research firm.
This represents approximately 272 million pounds of Hershey barres, suckers, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark barres.
It's a super news for the 41 million children who go to the candy market in their voisinage, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we will buy and, don't tell stories, eat 41 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
corn candy is the only thing you don't want to eat; and yet almost 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't yet come to éluize.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than hilly houses.
They carry the best names, like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is in fact a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 housing-style homes recognized officially in the United States, which generate about $500 million in proceeds, according to America Haunts, and that includes those formidably beautiful pictures of you in the process of paging up your friends that you can't remove and on which a type you like right leaves a comment of the "lovely head" style.
Finally, talk about cigar.
Charlie Brown showed us The Grosse Citrouille when we were youngsters, and sculpting a cigar in a lanterne is like décoting a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were just a little kid.
Fortunately for us, the "bébé-civic-cigar trend" began only last year through Pinterest, meaning most of us sculpted those pods and didn't have to sit inside.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on cigars, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The cigar cigars that are flushing gently on the pore of your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million cigars were cultivated this year.
If you're looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try sculpting their 922-pound cigar.
Transport of écolier: complaint ruled recevable
The CSRS / CSRS School District (CSRS) has since the beginning of the school year required fees of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students receiving school transportation to two homes, a service the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Before the changes made to the last budget, no financial contributions were demanded.
"There is a mediation service being offered by the commission and I was interested," said Ms Lefèvre.
To her, CSRS was asked for mediation and she asked for additional time to think about it.
"It's always better to talk, to concerter and find solutions," says Ms. Lefèvre.
The CSRS scolaires District (CSRS) did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
The organization has only signaled that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Congo: Army attacks last rebels stronghold
The irréductibles M23, or some hundred fighters, were retranchés at nearly 2000 feet of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located about 80 miles north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," a resident of Jomba, reached by phone around 12h30, and according to a girl was wounded by balle in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has declined a bit," he said, "it appears that the FARDC National Liberation Forces have repoussé a bit the rebels."
To that witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before climbing to the front for a "ratisse operation."
We heard very significantly behind him bleepish automatic gunfire.
From Bunagana, a political stronghold and the last strong city of the rebellion falling Wednesday, an AP reporter could hear heavy weapons fire.
In a source at the United Nations Mission for stabilisation in Congo, the fighting has entered "a final phase," with the FARDC "encercling the positions of M23 résidually to oust them."
Since the return on Friday of clashes between the Mouvement for the 23 Mars (M23) and the army, the Monusco does not directly engage in the fighting, but it provides government troops with pivotal support in intelligence, observation and planning.
In late afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well-loaded with ammunition, rose in front of the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
A day earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, a postcode with Uganda, military personnel aided by civilians were loading a multiple rocket lance-roquettes fire on a flambant neuf FARDC truck, expected to provide the lead for another device pilfering M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese's president, Joseph Kabila, on Wednesday night again called on the rebels to "disarm voluntarily" under the threat of being disarmed "by force," but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and MM23 have been talking since December without a result for now.
On the ground, political leaders of M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, there is only one way the outward médiation can organize the signing," said Roger Lumbala, vice president of the M23 delegation, without that information be confirmed immediately from the government side.
MM23 was born from a mutiny on April 12, 2012, by former rebels, mainly tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace deal.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which Kigali and Kampala deny.
North Kivu is one of Congo's most densest regions, and its basement regurgitated mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the outrigger side of the border, where about 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday according to the U.N., the return movement to Congo that had enclenché at the morning broke off.
"This morning we retraversé to go to our fields, but the military told us to repent ourselves," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including a nourrisson on her back.
You have the impression that the shots are moving toward populations.
In early evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a blanket on their head, to spend the night in Uganda.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza-sces
Israeli chars fire on Thursday killed an Islamic militant from Hamas and seriously wounded another in southern Gaza, officials said after sources from health services said.
A source from Hamas said fighting erupted in that region, because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian rocket fire.
The Israeli military was content to mention "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel described as "terrorist" by the Jewish state, dug up at the border and whose discovery was announced in late October.
concern linked to security in Mozambique grows in same time as conflicts éclatt between powerful figures
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, trying to toil them, thousands gathered in Maputo's central square to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to return; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.
Inquiète for her country's future, she traded her work clothes for a tee-shirt bearing the inscription "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd amassing on the capital's Indépendance Square Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been nearly every day reports faisant état of disputes between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, backed at the start by Rhodesia ruled by white farmers then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to déstabiliser the country's independent government.
After a peace deal signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts think the country should not fall into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The issue is considerable for the growing economy because the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 Md in investment over the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and main political force since 1975, and Renamo are mutuellement rejeté responsibility for the tensions.
The Renamo declares that the government is at the forefront of the recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Renamo stronghold, on Oct. 17.
The assault on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo's bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo spokesman, the Financial Times said.
The government makes Renamo responsible for starting the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns regarding instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday, the French news agency, that Mr Dhlakama regarded himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces it was left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr Mazanga declared that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace deal.
He told the FT that he wanted to say the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest sérieux," Mr. Mazanga said.
previous talks between the sides failed to ease tensions fueled by a string of disputes this year.
"These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who don't stop fighting," said Joseph Hanlon, an open university conférencier and Mozambique expert.
None of them knows how to negotiate and none of them is willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had previously said it would boycotter municipal elections due to take place in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as the attempt by a ailing movement to win concessions and a treasure trove of government cash.
The share of votes collected by Renamo has kept falling since 1992, while a new party, Mozambique's Democratic Movement for Democratic Change (MDM) which was created by a former Renamo member, is expected to win a greater number of votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said Mr. Guebuza - who is expected to step down at the end of his second term next year - wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want multipartite democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," Mr Mazanga said.
We don't know exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has carried out brief brief disrupted attacks on police linepeine and vehicles on a major North African highway route.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred miles north of Maputo, but where Beira is, the port from which mining companies, notably Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio could barely use the rail route for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr Mazanga was faussly shy when asked if the Renamo would repeat that threat.
The Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.
The instability has reinforced the frustrations the government is causing, declared Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, speed of development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think the officials of the future of the country are the government and the president, and it's up to that person to find solutions to the problems," he said.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
"Nobody one stands by the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads," he said.
Pia death at least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia had an unusual bout of fever Thursday night.
Three police vehicles, two ambulances and an attroupement of a couple of people according to accounts collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on Pia's side where a rixe involving several people erupted off the Royal Exchange.
Four légers injuries at least were to be reported.
Alerted police were called to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure the injured were taken to hospital.
Pasteur charged with child pornography in Nouvelle-Écosse
A pastor who was caring for the teens, in Halifax County in Maine, is charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, now 30, was arrested Friday morning following raids at his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
Timberbaptiste church in Timberlay, where the pastor was teaching, is deeply shocked by this news.
In a statement, church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins has resigned from his post.
The pastor was released on bail.
He must include not communicating with people under 18 and not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court, Halifax, in December.
Coulson used phone piratage to check tuyau
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bid-and-mouth tuyau about a liaison involving the then then under secretary of state, Charles Clarke.
ProProcureur General Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "lovely special adviser."
It was reported to court that the paper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, with pirating Pawlby's phone box and "planting in front of his door," but Coulson also called her and left her vocational messages.
"The indictment suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the NotW editor, is not the kind of man to stay outside people's homes hoping to surprise them, he's the kind of man to love presenting the story to people to see what they are saying," Mr Edis said.
He said NotW was using three ways to investigate the issues: phone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is over the second, surveillance, he can't be otherwise.
But what is it about the first?
Have he knowledge of phone piratage?
He says the opposite, but we say "Well, so if so."
Reports about a affair involving Clarke were picked up in the first place by the NotW bureau when a source, experiencing sexual attirance towards Mlle Pawlby, said that one had told her: "Don't lose your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, on which stolen vocational messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Detectives also found seized foreclosures on the private investigator's computer that involved Mlle Pawlby and her sister ranted in a "Protest" case.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Mlle Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls where one asked for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup have supervisé surveillance of Mlle Pawlby's moindres facts and gestes.
In a vocal message he left to him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story we plan to release tomorrow which I'd really like to talk to Charles."
Mr Edis said Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same schéma as with other important men, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr Blunkett over a affair with a married woman while himself fréquentates co-défenderesse Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspirging with others to pirater phones between Oct. 3, 2000 and Aug. 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted making phone piracy.
Plan $325 million loan aimed at Tasmanian health care system
The federal government maintains that the $325 billion bailout plan intended to help the vacated health care system is assorti of strict conditions aimed at ensuring the state government does not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said the Commonwealth is currently taking "urgent steps" to end a crisis caused by the vieillissement of the insulin-living population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the system's constraints.
The funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after consultations with the government's independent Tasmanian MP, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue package which, to us, will solve the unique difficulties facing the state," Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for nonurgent surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopédic surgery and cataract surgery, will help catch up.
funds are also planned for no-charge clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical cadres, services dedicated to mental health and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments address the idea that, of course, clinicians are the best way to treat Tasmanian health care system," Ms Plibersek said.
The minister said the government of Tasmania would be facing a strict regime of planning and redress.
The state will have to maintain current funding levels so that Commonwealth money can receive and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it spends the extra funds.
A commission made up of three people will be formed to guarantee that the state provides the services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that the £325 million will not count for much "at least until they are followed by a true reform helping to consolidate Tasmanian public health system."
He nonetheless praised the government for responding to the urgent aid request he presented to the Prime Minister early last week.
"I hope the federal aid plan will help greatly remove Tasmanian public health system from the blacklist," Mr. Wilkie said.
Under the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will insert in large part the recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton thinks today's announcement is a "fortune solution."
"The reason we are here is the Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system," he said on ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that arraché almost a half-billion dollars and the Commonwealth putting $300 million, and claim it's a faste day.
Mr Dutton paid tribute to Ms Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from the rescue plan will be spent on extra bureaucracies.
He walks through the mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance.
Dr. Georges BWillWillert dispense free health care in villages in Cameroun
Dr BWillWillert and his team spend almost all their weekends seeing hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this western African country, just 1 in 5,000 people.
Votez here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges BWillWillert is one of the 10 CNN Héros of the Year of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him "CNN Héros of the Year."
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges BWillWillWiller-in-Chief watched his ailing father alterate periods of conscience and indifference and drive to hospitals that weren't equipped to come to him.
Jamef BindWillink was injured in a car crash in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At the beginning, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread through his brain, creating a hémator that he would carry the séquelles for the remainder of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges BindWillert said.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
On top of that, Dr. BWillWillWillert spent years accompanying his father to clinics and hospitals packed, for him to get any treatment that he could receive.
"It is not easy," Mr. BWillWillbroy added.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., head to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation hasn't changed much since Dr. Bwelle's death in 2002.
In Cameroun, there is just 1 doctor for 5,000 residents, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the U.S. is 1 doctor for 413 residents.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroans might not pay for the consultation.
Two in five people in the country live in the dessous of the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country's health care spending is made in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," said Dr. BWillWillert.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his fellow Japanese suffer, Dr. BWillWillbroff was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr.., Georges BWillWillert and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 surgical procedures free of charge over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central Yaoundé Hospital.
And he created a nonprofit humanitarian charity, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas during weekends to dispenser free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with a couple of people, they entombed in fourgonnettes after setting the medical equipment on the roof and crossing difficult land to get to the villages that have most need of help.
luck doesn't always suit them.
They repeatedly had to push vehicles to cross rivers or narrow pistes.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community runs a party, sings and dance and offers them the best homes available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to make the most of it, and Dr. Bnettons - with his great smile and débordant energy - is more than happy to join in the festivities.
The next morning, the team begins receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people on each visit," Mr. Bnetti said.
They sometimes live 60 miles from the village, and they come on foot.
In this itinérant hospital, various health care services are prodigious.
As many as 50 people receive treatment for paludisme, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmission-related diseases.
Many others can receive blow-out, a pair of collected glasses or a free birth certificate - a document needed to go to school, but many poor families just can't afford to buy it.
On night, the team practices simple surgical procedures under local anesthésie.
The are in general performed in a school, council or house; after intervention, the patient stands up and walks into the réveil room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the électro-powered lighting, the operating room and the stérilisation of the equipment, Dr. Bnettons and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It's an eerily quiet pace, but the musicians from the villages in general help the team stay motivated.
"They frappe on tambours all night to hold us éreintently so we can continue to work," said Mr BWillWillert.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, fatigued but proud of the work it has accomplished.
The group, made up of camera-equipped doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical procedures free of charge over the past year, and it knows their presence can make all the difference to those to whom they come.
One man said the free operation he had had to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and my family's," the man said.
In addition to making this itinérant hospital work and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bnettons also works night in private medical cabinets around Yaoundé.
It's that second job, he explained, which funded 60 percent of his charity; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he dort," said Katie O' 'Malley, a second-year medicine student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Dr. BWillWillert's group.
He is still at the hospital or trying to find money for his charity so that he can run those campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O' 'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it's an opportunity to learn on the ground they don't have home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help clear blood or get the instruments to Dr. BWillWillbroh," said Mlle O' 'Malley.
This is something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a graduate student in the second year.
The students pay in general for their trip through Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transport and teaching are taken care of by Dr. Bnettons.
"He's a hero, there's no question," Katie O' 'Malley said.
He gives his life for this charity, and his desire to help the camera-armed people is not likely to die.
For Dr. BWillWillWillert, relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Aider others to live heureux by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I am so happy when I do this," Mr. Bwelle said.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons that drive me to do this.

Land Rover announces parrainage of a series of rallyes
The interior has baquet seats and 6 Stearns ceintures, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options, there are included improved brakes, a service giving the Bowler Works mécanicians access, logistics support and vehicle entrees between two events.
Drew Bowler, Bowler Motorsport's chief executive said: "The rallyes fans who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some seek excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced this will be a new way to try at different forms of rallyes in Britain and international, and prepare for the riddles and realities of the raid rallyes.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle - the championship is going to really be paltry. "
As a result, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the chance to participate in events in the desert of northern Africa and the Middle East.
The two France's Pierre Nora
Perplexes, academics have long peered at defining and situer Pierre Nora.
Professeur in amphitheaters and lecture halls?
No doubt, but noting his low for the beaten path, Sciences-Po, Hautes Etudes.
Arbitre from others' works in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
In fact, but ignoring the publisher's hidden work and underground writing.
Héritier of the chair Fontenelle occupated at the French Academy?
Sure still, but knowing that such a triumph would not replace the true holy oil, that of the claim, which it has happened.
They readily recognized him as a great eater, host and fédérateur of their work, but by making observer aware that he was unwilling to produce himself.
To that uncertain image the monument of the "Lievils of memory," which he attached to his name, also contributed.
The mischievous languages were able to see a massive farmers' market, presented by an intelligent commentateur, equipped with a sharp eye and lesser-known with érudits, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora nearly two years ago already established that anyone who went to not write had a lot and well written.
The book here is expected to finally pay him justice.
You actually find, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagding, jubilation set to jump like a foot soldiers from one subject to another.
But you soon understand that the disparaging objects gathered in this book with such a fine title will bring the brow to one and unique passion: that of discovering the noeud constitutionally important of French identity.
Why are these devastating calls for national unity?
Identité: It's an era concern.
Voici a few, we have collectively been conviés to give a definition.
But in the pétrified spirit of our leaders of then, French identity was an intrepid essence.
It only took to deploy the accidents, and the matter, jacobinite oblige, was handed to the préfets and the sous-préfets, authorized interprètes.
Celle that Pierre Nora traque is just another.
He does not pose as an heir to an éternelle francité, he objects to definition.
Analyst concerned with a familiar étrangeté, he walks through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of a rebus, tourmenting with irritating questions.
Dont this, which né out of the company itself: Why, in a country so permanently established in its borders, so formerly charted and firmly maçbehind, hear these devastating calls for unity?
They are so pressants, Pierre Nora suggests, only to balance the trouble born of disappointments of French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most iconic one is obviously one that fend off the national story.
As of the Revolution earthquake, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monastic, the other revolutionary.
The second meant the death of the first, but without parvenir to deny it; keen at the same time to find the sacrament and of course avenging unity and indivisibilité that she had cut off the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, a nation invincibly binary, split between left and right, laïcité and catholicism, adoration and hatred of revolution.
To make that singularity of French identity, nothing vaut the four steps out of the UK, so much so that Pierre Nora's American escapade may well be the heart of his book.
Yet America and France have one and the other made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to start a new society.
But the American coupling does only further highlight what is clean to us.
Là-bas, men who had left their Ancien Régime in England and had no one to worry about.
Here, men encombred with an Old Régime indigenous, and of course more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here it has semé drama and confounded it.
There generations of founding fathers are still honored, and here revolutionary ancestors whose names we are struggling to make models, and who have for the time been entre-up.
There an institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, like so many mistakes to catch up and essais to resume.
France who is going, France coming
There was actually an era when the French thought they could match the torn dress in their history, and defeat the malédiction of number two.
At this IIIe République, central and creator moment, Pierre Nora showed much interest and even tendresse: praising those who then helped to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything in the former French Republic that obscurantly prepared modern France and offering them a unifying version of their history.
But that pacified identity only got a while.
The now faces debate, bousculed by immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of social minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book now offers both the fascinating portrait of France moving forward and the circonspects of France coming forward.
With, in the background, the historian's portrait, which is expected to réserve some surprises.
You discovered that the chemineau was a cashier.
The man of multiple curiosités was turning, slightly obsessively, around a single idea.
The rôdeur rôder stood at the center of the center.
And anyone who had filed, more than a decade ago, a subject on the idea of nation, but had soustrait to the initial-of-the claim, tells us, cum grano salis, that he will have ended it.
Certainly under a less raiding, more éclatent and more subtly modern kind.
But don't worry, just as binding.
Yet far more than the imposée figure of the college curriculum, this thèse-ci says the domestic need of a life.
How biométrie will envahit our lives
Forget the words to pop to access your phone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers are warning us of a future where we will be recognized by biomarker sensors in phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, chief executive of Morpho, even says "the century will be biométrique."
Only biométrie will help ensure a person making transactions in an universe as transnational and transnational as the Internet.
organizations dedicated to protecting privacy confirm this engouement for biométrie, but are worried.
Other in 2011 and in the UK, the National Security and libertés Commission has allowed 774 trace recognition systems, the shape of the hand or veering network in companies, administrations, cantonese...
"Everybody will soon be able to be identified, any time and when," said Justin Brookman, senior consumer privacy officer at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among the few, and pessimisme, among others?
biométrie will tap into new techniques, which will help deliver new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in the UK, the most used biomarker data are digitally cropped empreintes, hand contour and veal network or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
"By contrast, some people who work the concrete have their fingers very damaged and their fingerprints are illiterate," finds Philippe Robin, technical director of the identitaire field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as checking the veal network and the hand contour suppose a voluntary and specific gesture by the people.
It's both security - you can't capture these data at their behalf - and an inconvénient: The procedure sometimes needs to be repeated and therefore takes time.
Conséquence, research has been conducted for a number of years on other approaches, such as face recognition or iris (the colorless part of the eye).
Thanks to increasing the precision of the sensors and the computer's computer's memory capacity for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The précision of facial-recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, Accenture's R & D research laboratory director in Europe.
With our help, Britain and Hollande have deployed automatic postcards using facial-recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or iris in motion.
"Right we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but it's about a silent environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
Marqueur unique and infalsifiable, DNA also suscite hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biométrique donnée," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and prospective research at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very costly.
NEC offers police officers a valise costing £95,000 to analyze DNA samples on the scene of a crime and in an hour.
The use of biométrie is split into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (ensuring the person is the one it claims to be).
The identification until now involved issuing identity papers: it's difficult to confronter biomarker evidence (fingerprints, photo, iris) with information the state has about all citizens already five- and older.
This helps ensure that a person does not attempt to usurp someone else's identity.
This comparison principle can have other applications.
NEC offers such VIP recognition at a hotel or store.
"We pick up images from the surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities who travel freely on the Internet," said Dany Nassif, a manager, at NEC France, for commercial development for biométrique identification solutions.
Another use: take in a quip that makes the queue in a store, track its progress through facial-recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The authentication involved at first physical access (borders, local protected areas, cantonaries...) or lofty (opening of a computer).
Next was, more recently, presence control.
"A biométrique pointment avoided the copain phenomenon points for another," justifie Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also involve transactions, in particular those made using devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money at some retailers by introducing your card and putting your hand on a biométrique reader: this gesture replaces the strike of the secret code.
A similar technique is being tested in Villeneuve-d' Ascq and Angoulême by the Natural Security Company in partnership with banks and major retail enseignes: at the time of paying in with your bank card, the customer does not tape your code, but introduce your finger into a reader that scares the veins.
The expérimentation is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusif, biomarker readers could soon arrive at UK retailers.
New pistes to reassure users
There are three ways to make biométrie attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can make money.
"If, thanks to biométrie, a customer stays in caisse 30 seconds less, it's appréciable," said the manager of a large store.
The second is to offer personnalized services: within years, a vocal server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you options on the go.
And, finally, reassure by setting out the precautions taken to protect data bases.
"The digital-rights fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second base: the corrélation between the two numbers is crypted and stored in a highly secure boîtier, which blocks it if you're trying to move it," énumères Philippe Robin, of Thales.
But, unless you have extensive studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really persuade users.
Law protection specialists, however, continue to worry.
"progrès progrès in facial-recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicted Andrew Patrick, of the National Security Agency's Office of Information Technology in Canada.
Frontier Airlines considers getting hand luggage
Frontier Airlines is considering making up to $100 pay to passengers who carry hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines is considering starting to make up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could carry the unopened canister with them on the way out of the plane.
The new bag charges cover bags ranered in the upper compartiment, meaning small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would make $25 if the fees were paid at the time and $100 if travelers paid only once at the embarquement gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O' 'Malley said the $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fees at the same time.
"We don't want to get that price," she said.
Airlines began to make passengers pay first and second reported luggage in 2008.
Passengers who were trying to avoid these fees were putting as much as they could in the hand luggage ranered in the upper compartiments, so there was often no place in those compartiments.
These fees are a way of ensuring passengers carry fewer things on board.
O' 'Malley said those new fees will not really serve to raise money.
It is about making Frontier's most loyal customers understand that it is becoming more difficult to find room in the upper compartiments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Similarly, a passenger making the queue at a Frontier ticket counter could carry a bag free, while the next person in the queue may have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O' 'Malley said Frontier's site and recording procedures are set to change to guarantee passengers know the existence of these fees before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier's cash baggage fees will not be implemented until next summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often rouse themselves about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They say the costs of manutention baggage are significant and that passengers who want that service should pay it.
Good many people on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that proves that airlines are making enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Indeed many of them did not pay baggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had implemented the first bag charges three years ago, and low-cost airline Allegiant followed a few years later.
The only other airline imposing such fees is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said consultant with airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the fees in addition.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit's baggage fees were worth $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the front door at the same time passengers would find unMerrill's unMerrill baggage fees imposed by the airline.
"I had never seen such a fluide embargoes procedure in my professional career," he declared.
I was expecting to see grincements of dents and a fight erupted at the door.
The plane was full, he said, "the passengers rose to the speed of the éclair."
Frontier also does like Spirit and applies fees of $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can carry the unopened canister with them, and those who take coffee can be resold free.
It will always distribute water free.
US Airways briefly tried to get the drinks to pay for in 2008 but came back down seven months later after passengers complained and as no other major airline had followed suit.
Frontier's decision to make bag fees charged when passengers do not directly buy their ticket from the airline provides its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines airlines charge online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of calling an online travel agency.
Still, Frontier went further in that area.
In September, it began offering only half a mile loyalty miles to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
Wednesday, she cut miles on a trip.
Similarly, a Frontier trip de1,000 miles bought from an online travel agency would help gain 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat at the same time only if they buy their ticket directly on Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal following in its home town, Denver, but its business is falling and it is losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and its flight capacity declined almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to redresser Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
Scientists are to set out how a dog's tail movements are linked to its mood.
More previous studies had found that happy dogs were remuing more their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs were remuing it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtly different differences and respond.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a Trente year-old neuroscientist, said: "Everyone knows that, in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in a different way in stimuli that edit positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to see what it was like in other species.
He said that as well as in the human, the dogs' right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and both hémisphères were playing a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how the dogs react to other dogs' disordered tail movements, the researchers followed animals while trying to watch movies where other dogs featured.
They measured the animals' heart frequency and analyzed their behavior.
It will surely not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed dogs films where other dogs featured - either a natural-looking version or silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion - and we were able to sie the tail movement and present it as going further left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without an expression remnant its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog remnant the tail), they remained perfectly detachable.
But when they spotted a tail dévier mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog remnant the tail), their heart frequency accelerated and they had the anxious look.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs were deliberately communicating between them through these movements.
He thinks instead dogs know by experience the movements that they should or should not worry about.
He said: "If you have repeatedly returned to other dogs and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side results in a less friendly attitude, you will re-engage in that experience."
The researchers indicate the results could help owners, vétérinaires and dresseurs better understand their animals' emotions.
Canin behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol's School of vétérinary Sciences, said this was the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that the dogs turned their head to the left when they watched an aggressive dog and toward the right when it was a joyeux dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "The dogs were more easily going to a robot dog when its tail remuated to the left rather than the right, instead of becoming anxious - the opposite of what appears in the Italian study."
He said the differences could come from the fact that dogs participating in the various studies did not consider animals from movies or robot dogs to be dogs.
A study into how dogs react to real dogs may be useful, he said.
"Although many evidence, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used to different purposes, good number of details still need to be précisated - and dogs do not make exception," he said.
Still, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will surely not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Lancement of accessoires shop for Google Glass
An online shop, offering multiple dedicated Google Glass accessories, is to be set up by thousands of developers possédant a prototype of the Google's Google glasses.
They can further acquire an écouteurs, charge-card or even a rancher's battery étui.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already using Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charge-off and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protection hack made in micro-fibres or an intra-auricular écouteur.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no big-scale commercialisation date has yet been confirmed.
Living together in English, the challenge of Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school system, 62 percent of students have a language other than English.
That is what prompted, a year ago, a consultation with parents, pupils, teachers and members of the education staff, to consider ways to better integrate students who live at a cost between several cultures.
The school district is to unveil its vision for "Vivre together in English."
The nonprofit Vision diversity has been walking for a year through schools to help students of all ages discover common repères that do not extend to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are repères.
Great great names of writers, artists, whether they are of souche or they came from elsewhere.
Who are our bâtisseurs?
"So, we're creating projects in a way that they identify with all of that," said Vision diversity president Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the New York Institute of Technology, identified several challenges for the school district.
"On the transmission, by contrast, of what American culture is, sense of belonging, support for the staff in the transformations we're having, within the student base," he explained.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys County school district has created a research center that will give tools to teachers who, too sometimes, come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, of the University of New York, will be the scientific director.
The preparation to handle a class in a nord-américain, American context.
"different educational strategies, that's what's the true need," she résume-t-elle.
The research will focus on inclusion under all its angles: ethnic, school, social and cultural.
Obama ends tapes targeting IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has given the National Security Agency (NSA) a warning to end the tapes it was conducting on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a US official says on Thursday.
That decision is part of the White House's attempt to regain control in the NSA surveillance case after revelations made by former analyst Edward Edward espie, réfugié in Russia.
It is the first time that the IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal.
Asked on the issue, a US administration official responded: "The US is not conducting electronic surveillance targeting the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington."
Speaking speaking on condition of anonymity, this official did not say whether such surveillance had been put in place by the past.
A other official said, however, that Barack Obama had given orders to stop these practices over the past weeks.
That instruction was given at least at the same time as one ending the tapes of the UN headquarters in New York.
In that regard, the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday approved a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programs but allowed their prosecution.
The commission introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on conservation of those data.
European Bourses on the decline at mi-séance, except London
At London's main stock markets traded lower Friday at mi-séance, plombed by some news from disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to open higher.
By contrast, investors remain cautious because they feel the U.S. Federal Reserve may dénouer its monetary easing policy sooner than expected.
At the same time, after news of inflation at 0.7 percent for the entire euro zone, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) may ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures suggest an opening for U.S. stocks higher, after two consecutive sessions of decline.
Among valeurs, Renault (-3.63 percent) recorded the biggest decline in the CAC 40, hurt by the profit warning from partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-5.26 per cent) marks the worst performance in the EuroFirst300, after also reporting lower results this morning and announcing the creation in interne of a défaisance ("bad bank") structure representing 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
On its part, Vodafone (+ 1.45%) is holding up the EuroFirst 300 gains in response to a media report that AT & T is considering a possible takeover.
On the currency exchange, speculation about the outlook for the ECB's monetary policy is going on, as is John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's single mandate has always focused on inflation, meaning Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act in next week's meeting.
We anticipate strong euro rate drop.
In that sense, the euro continued its decline against the U.S. currency and in the session hit a two-week low of $1,351.17.
Those same conjectures support at least the euro zone bond market.
That ruling means a bill passed in July in that state and largely turning down the right to abortion will be able to go into effect.
Du classical music for teenagers
At every time, it is the school clientèle that will be targeted, an initiative that had had a lot of success over the previous season.
At five saynètes imagining and performed by region artists, vignettes containing a high dose of humor, we allow teenagers to apprivoise classical singing.
Besides that show, the Company's Royal Opera House will return with its lyrical Destinations, a formula that now makes it to the Pulpasses in Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, which gives West End artists the chance to show what they are capable of.
Among those activities has been the lyrique Apéro, the concert-bénéfice held in August, with the help of soprano colorist Marie-Ève Munger.
It was an active-duty active-duty, parallèlement to the creative dimension, and it helped the nonprofit organization produce a financial record that is as warm to the ears as an air of La chauve-souris.
Without livrer specific numbers, board chairman Yves Bergeron used the news conference held yesterday, in Chicoutimi, to sound rassurant.
Despite the précarité that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is drawing up well, even at long last.
We have stronger and consistent support.
"The finances are at risk and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opérette, a step we will cross in seven years," said the administrator.
"I'd even say beyond that," the chief executive, Hélène Gaudreault, said, smiling.
Congolese army pourchasser M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) said Thursday its units would hunt down M23 rebels deep in their bases located in the forests and mountains of North Kivu province neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.
MM23 appears on the verge of being beaten after being ousted from the northeastern towns of the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC) it had controlled since the start, 20 months ago, of the insurgency.
"We will pursue M23 and accede to it wherever it lies because it is criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a spokesman for the FARDC, told Reuters.
We don't need to let them regroup because they martyrzed the Congolese people for too long.
Time time has come to bring peace.
MM23 officials said they evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, a senior rebel political official, said on RFI that those military setbacks would in no way alter his demands for peace talks.
Those, according to outed mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between Kinshasa's government and M23.
Other clashes are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the latest town at the hands of insurgents to fall this week, as well as the alentours of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion last set in 2012.
At their apogée in November, insurgents occupied Goma, the chef-lieu of North Kivu province, benefiting from the release of the government's garnison and the passivité of the Monusco bleus peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma prompted the United Nations Mission to Congo, the largest in the world in terms of numbers, to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid intervention force made up of South African, malawan and tanzese troops.
On its own, the FARDC état-major has been remanied and the army has gone on the offensive against M23, bringing the course of the war to a halt.
The pace of government troops' progress is now no surprise.
"MM23 seems to be coming to an end," predicted a Congolese affairs expert, Jason Stearns, on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historic - it would be the first time Kinshasa's government manages to beat a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that any armed group allied with Rwanda would be active in eastern Congo.
United experts accuse Rwanda, which fiercely denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, made up of former Congolese military mutiny.
British's foreign secretary, William Hague, urged Rwandan President Paul Kagame to make sure he was free, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali had raised the possibility of military retaliation following the rockets falling in Rwanda's territory.
Wednesday, residents of Bunagana filled the streets of the bourgade to greet the arrival of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be freed by the army," témoigne a resident of this border town limitroph from Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatized," this man said.
John Kerry admitted, a fact unheard of, that American spying "had gone too far in an unresponsible way."
John Kerry said a radoucissement of the United States' defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs by admettent, a fact without a doubt, that on several occasions spying "had gone too far in an unresponsible way."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, along with Barack Obama, ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by denunciateur Edward Edward lecturator over the NSA spying activities first came to light.
The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking speaking during an intergovernmental conference in London by video liaison, Mr Kerry said: "It is evident that the President, myself and other members of the Government took advantage of some of the things in automatic pilot mode because we had the ability, from World War II and through the difficult years of the Cold War, then right after September 11."
He later became the first senior member of the United States government to admit that U.S. spying had exceeded the bornes, but stressed that each's rights had not been violated.
He said: "In some cases it went too far in an unsuitable way."
And the President is resolved to try to clarify and clearly state to people that he is now procédé to an extensive reinvestigation of these practices so no one will be mislead.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse as part of this process.
Mr. Kerry stressed, however, that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He said: "We live in a new world where people are prepared to get up."
There is a radical extremism around the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have bel and well prevented planes from falling, buildings from explode and people from being murdered because we were able to take advantage of the facts at the same time.
Meanwhile, U.S. législators will travel to Europe to address concerns regarding the alleged U.S. spying case and convince Europeans of the need to pursue joint efforts to fight terrorism with the United States, said the chairman of the Senate's undersecretary of state for European affairs Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken to members of the European parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about threats they had made regarding a possible withdrawal from anti-terror organizations because of the sense of frustration that National Security Agency surveillance is causing.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain at our side in mutual commitment to fighting terrorism," Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate's undersecretary of state for European affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I'll be going to Europe to get them to understand that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs.
The press reported that the NSA captured millions of communications in Europe, which set off relations with some of the United States allies, though the agency's director said this week that it was inexact and that it was a malpractice because this involved métadonnées NATO allies had colluded and shared with the United States.
Other other revelations included documents divulgué by Edward pedophiles that the NSA had intercepted data and communications coming from Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
The intelligence director, James Clapper, justified the allies' spying by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In that atmosphere of tumult, Murphy said his office was hosting a Congress trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of the other participating législators are expected to be unveiled in the days ahead.
He said the route remained to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to help improve relations, but also make sure "affectueuse fermeté."
He said European leaders needed to be honest with their citizens over the type of spying programs they themselves have implemented for years.
"We can modify our surveillance programs so that we better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world doing espionage," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to handle the rancour generated by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States' surveillance activities.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the Celtic captain, has had his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for his club's next two Champions League matches, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsed against Barcelona for sending a pass to Neymar, the Scotland midfielder has had his suspension extended to three games by UEFA.
In a statement, his club was "very disappointed," saying his appeal was entirely justified.
For Titan CEO, "Goodyear's proposed purchase of Amiens starts with zero employee."
After throwing himself out with fracas in January for the partial reprise of the Goodyear plant in Amiens-Nord promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of US pneumatical Titan, is declared on today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 the plant has.
Arnaud Montebourg, the minister for redressement productif, had already announced it on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the plant's plan to buy back in January, you are returning today.
You had delivered violent attacks and insults, talking about "supposedly workers," who "work three hours" a day, "crazy unions," targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this Now.
Is to make Mr Montebourg happy?
I'm trying to make it easy for anybody to make it.
Except to my wife.
Mr Montebourg, is a charming young man trying to save industrial jobs among the best-paid.
If I've injured someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment too.
The truth blemishes you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours handicaps the UK.
In India, China and lots of other countries, we work 10 to douze hours a day.
But I don't have any préjugés about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well-located and has space to expand.
Why Titan has so much to do with this plant?
Titan doesn't have to buy that plant.
But, with a correct price and competent workers, that vaut the price to try.
What type of agreement would you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since news of the plant's closure, Goodyear had offered workers a good pay package, I think 100 percent of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, imagine that Titan is buying Goodyear the closed plant.
From then on, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows this.
Yet, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among Goodyear's roughly 1 200 current workers.
So Mr Montebourg will have to make a commitment from Titan before he can try to bring the CGT to a table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on pay packages for all employees.
From then on, there will be no employees in the factory.
Mr Montebourg said you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs throughout four years.
Do confirmez-vous?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he would want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first get together on pay packages.
If all workers accept them, the plant's proposed purchase starts with zero employee.
How could we give job length guarantees when there are no employees on site?
If Mr Montebourg manages to get the CGT and Goodyear to get together and Titan buy the plant, we have got to stay in Amiens-Nord more than four years.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shootout took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10am local time when a man opened fire.
To local police, there were at least 2 wounded.
It would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the target of the shots.
The incident allegedly happened at terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Passengers and staff ran to the sorties or on the tarmac.
Very soon police forces arrived and a man suspected of being the gunman was arrested on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is under evacuation and air traffic is halted.
Supreme Court valide Obama health care reform law
Big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court said today that the health care reform law signed by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the justices validé the individual mandate for Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Health Care Act and affordable care) - which requires citizens to sign up for health insurance by 2014, under the threat of having to pay a fine - and declared it was constitutional in accordance with the government's tax revenue.
Supreme Court president John Roberts agreed with the court's four most liberal members, while Justice Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed disagreement.
The court also validé the other 2,700 pages of the 2,700 pages law and, by contrast, considered that the provision in the health care reform law, which states it's important to lower the age élieligibility seuil for Medicaid under the threat of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive according to the constitution.
The procedure aimed at blocking the law has been engaged by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican presidential candidates up for re-election over the 2012 primaries, including désigné candidate Mitt Romney, have been fiercely opposed to the law.
Aretha Franklin will remonstrate to scène in December
The Detroit News reported that the soul queen will perform Dec. 21 at the Sound Board at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
Ms. Franklin was working in November on recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without préciser the disease she was suffering, the late Respect singer had told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult."
She says she is "happy to be back."
It would be possible to teach mysteries and légendes to children as "living style models," the author stated.
Thor's hardworking reprint may show that "brutal force does not make the most of the subversive ruse," while archeological legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Disruling that many mysteries would be "far too violent, far too scandaleux and in some cases, far too obfuscous to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland recommended a "careful selection" of the works suitable for age.
"I find it tremendous that in America, mysteries and folklore already make up for education," he said.
I've been pushing in support of this for 20 years.
He said the fact that the authors and teachers are "openly didactical" makes children "learn totally," with messages being "sublimely" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the anglo-saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You probably have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Maybe the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not not that everything dovetails or ends well, but there is an unspoken sense of the good and the bad.
And it must be sublimely; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known foundation of what you're showing and what you're not saying.
Feu vert from US to Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they had received no objection from the U.S. regulators to their merger, further moving closer to creating the world's largest advertising agency.
The merger in the process moves the world's second-largest agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe announced today the expiration of the previously announced merger time of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, planned by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the companies announced in a statement.
They state that they have also received the necessary approvals in the United States, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiration of the scheduled HSR hearing in the US and approval decisions issued in other jurisdiction meet many of the conditions necessary for the réalisation of the deal.
"The merger is also conditionally subject to the obtention of other regulatory approvals and approval of the shareholders of both companies," they added.
New claim claims against Sainte-Croix brothers
A new civil suit has been filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, involving sexual assaults that would have occurred this time at the Saint-Joseph oratoire as well as several orphelinates, collèges and schools.
The motion was based on the testimony of the requérant, identified as "J. J.", who may have been masturated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his professor the brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph oratoire, where he was a messe and where his father worked as a painter.
The first challenge only involved three schools, and when we announced the settlement, a lot of people said, "moi, I was at such a place, can I sign up? '" recalled attorney Alain Arsenault, who represents the victims in both claims.
The legal action that is to be filed has the particularité of allowing plaintiffs from any facility where sévices could have been committed by members of the Sainte-Croix congregation.
At the moment, the challenge brings together the complaints of 25 people who say they were assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are in general older than those mentioned in the first challenge, although many of the schools targeted shut down in the 1960s.
The suit noted by contrast that the St. Croix congregation and Saint-Joseph's oratory, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual sévices to be committed upon children," that they "performed moral, religious and psychological contrainte on victims," that they "were aware of the sexual sévices commis and nonetheless strangled them," and that they "sciemment and consciously chose to ignore the issue."
These latest charges are based among other letters written by the Sainte-Croix brothers' lawyer, Mr. Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by research done in archives about that by the brother Wilson Kennedy, a former St. Croix brother who publicly denounced the sécession.
The legal challenge must first go to court.
Once the recevability adjoindre by the Court, you proceed with the second step, or hearings on the fond.
In the case of the first challenge, the Sainte-Croix congregation had agreed to settle at the amiable before hearings were carried out on the fond.
Congo: army prepares for fresh assault
Children play on a carbonated blindfolds that belonged to M23 rebels, in Kibumba on Oct. 31, 2013, in Eastern Congo.
The Congolese army was preparing for another assault Friday on the last remaining strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern Congo.
The aim is to déloger the M23 from the hills that overlook Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill from Bugina, which overlooks Mbuzi's.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from herself.
It will stay only on the hill of Runyonyi.
"One of Chanzu is not very strategic," North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr Paluku expects to travel Saturday to Bunagana.
Fief political and the last strong spot of the rebellion, this town is located at the outrigger border, about 80 miles north of Goma.
It was returned Wednesday by the Democratic Forces of the Republic of Congo Wednesday.
Since then, some hundred irréductibles on the M23, have been retranchés at nearly 2,000 feet of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported all-night fighting Thursday for much of the day said the situation had been "calm since this morning."
To him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting last night and were buried.
One girl was wounded by gunfire, and three other people were injured, one seriously, evacuated by the FARDC, this witness said.
Since the return of fighting between FARDC and rebels on October 25, the two belligerents have given no accounts of the losses in human lives.
Court blocks decision relating to NYPD's control and searches policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision requiring changes in the New York State Police Department's control and search program and despatched it from the case.
The United States District Court (second circuit) said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the outcome of the interjeter appel by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program aimed at controlling and questioning citizens.
The city has made public its findings and corrective sense sense, including a decision aimed at attribuer a contrôleur to help the police department alter its policy and training program that is associated with it.
The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday focusing on the suspension request.
The appeals court said the judge was to be desist from the case because she violated the judge's code of conduct by compel the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, in part because of a series of interviews granted to the media and public statements in which she publicly reacts to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by targeting black and hispanical men as part of their control and searches program.
It named an outside contrôleur to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and she ordered the implementation of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in neighborhoods where the greatest number of checks are taking place.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice consistant in retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the interjeté appeal by the city is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of testing and searches has been criticised by many civil rights advocates.
This system of testing and searches has existed for decades under some kind, but the number of reported checks increased in a dramatic fashion under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest all-time high in 2011 with 684,330 checks that mostly involved black and hispanian-American men.
A legal action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned out to be collective action.
Supporters advocates promoting changes in the NYPD's control and searches program say they will end infair practices, help have more efficient police forces and that we do, and will be able to change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say those changes would hurt the police's morale without driving down crime, would represent waste of money and would not revisit the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers have been sharply reduced over the last decade.
The judge said that she did not end the control and searches practices, which are constitutionally illegal, but that she was réformating the way the NYPD put in place its controls.
renseignement révélations increase security paranoïa about state surveillance
On a fine late summer day, a German police helicopter bombed low altitude the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American avant-garth, located less than 5 miles from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennes and that the operation prompted an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of the US intelligence community, stressed again in September that the United States does not use its capabilities in foreign intelligence to "steal foreign companies' industrial secrets for the benefit of American companies so as to increase their international competitiveness or increase earnings."
But since Edward Edward espie, the consultant turned dénonciator, began dévoiler his unrivaled treasure trove of information about the secrets of the U.S. surveillance, European governments and corporate leaders no longer know whether it's worth believe the director on the record.
Other reports, that the U.S. National Security Agency spy on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and got access to data held by U.S. storage services providers in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, more than ever prompted the companies' paranoïa about state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been pirated, perhaps even for a decade, was the goutte of water that sent the vase déborder.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Edward has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence agencies and companies.
I feel it is concevable that these data be used in their mutual interest.
"Germany needs to wake up," declared Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German small business small businesses in the TI sector.
German companies think the United States poses a risk as significant as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey released in July by the consulting firm EY.
However in all documents disclosed by Mr Manning, nothing at this point suggests that the United States has passed industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
The men have made clear their concern about the EU does not have adequate computer and Internet capabilities and think it should be trying to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business executives are skeptical about that.
A German Parliament lawmaker says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly...
"This is the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German business software company, SAP.
If you wanted a strong European TI industry, then it was not time to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subventionné in Germany, from coal to cars, in addition to farmers.
All except the TI industry.
Indeed, the scale and sophistication of US spying agencies exposed by the revelations from Edward espion have been a shock to some companies that until then thought China posed the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A big change is set to happen in the cloud computer because European officials have taken advantage of the fact that data kept in the United States is régied in accordance with the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
In a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional body, some 10 percent of non-U.S. members have renoncé to their plans to use a U.S. provider of storage services in the cloud after revelations about the US data exploration program Prism.
Jim Snabe, SAP co-chief executive, stated, "Our customers are now asking us a question they didn't ask us a year ago: Where are my data being kept and can you guarantee that they will stay physically in this jurisdiction?"
As many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already knew, to be that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that those data must by conséquent be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
"It's been a recurring issue for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed as a result of the current discussion," stated Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical producer BASF.
Americans Americans spy on the trade and industrial side just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business executives are generally unwilling to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place, at the risk that would leave the advantage to an opponent.
The companies have martSherratly martSherrato for years the message that it is for the most part impractical to pick up a free USB key during a professional salon or leave a laptop without surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of the automobile maker Audi, declared that collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so they can't be used as wireless listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
BBV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple pre-paid mobile phones during their trips abroad because of the risk of atteinte to the integrity of smartphones.
prépaid mobile phones are then thrown.
Still, one worries that small and mid-size businesses remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, good number of small companies are global leaders in their particular niche.
"PME often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unapproved access," BfV warns in a report.
The United States alerted their own companies to economic spying activities made by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States, quoted France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty in the second degree of conducting acts of economic intelligence, behind China, The Washington Post said.
A member of the board of a famous German company felt that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, a former French intelligence director, the mal despondent despicable despicable intelligence, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they co-operate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
New tax on foreign property owners to blow up London bubble
The Treasury has temporarily chiffré the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne which, in the 2012 budget, has included a 7 per cent rate for properties costing more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold properties as part of a society rather than as an individual.
The timbre fee already applies to the résident-owned properties in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea arrondissements, and represents £708 million over the fiscal year 2012 / 13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, Scotland, the Northeast and the Yorkshire and Humber region combined.
Mr Cook said: "Due to increasing the stamp duty on high value properties and the introduction of the anti-evading law in the past, it is very difficult to avancer that properties of great value are underimposed indépendamment of the effects of the obsolete council tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant about buying properties in London or current owners reluctant about the idea of selling," he said.
Real prestige - the 5 to 10 percent of the highest prices in the real estate market - in the prosperous area just southwest of London that runs from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record 13.8 percent percentage point in the last year.
Prices in central London show regular year to year growth of 5.6 per cent but were overshadowed by a growing "domestic" market, with the southwest of the city, the north (7.2 per cent) and the east (6.4 per cent) experiencing a recovery, according to Savills' research.
shutshutdown in US has hampered auto market rise
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations weighed on sales of car sales in the US in October, figures released Friday by automakers showed five of the top six posting below expectations.
Detroit Detroit's three major automakers show growth on average compared with October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts in the survey forecast 15.4 million sales in an annualised and adjusted seasonal variations but the market was up 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst.
In a note to bank customers, he says that slight slowdown was in part due to "the government 'shutdown' and its impact on consumer sentiment over the first quinzaine of the month."
GM nonetheless reported a nearly 16 percent increase in sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, up from 211 563 expected by the consensus.
The company's four brands saw their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit among other things from the success of its pick-up, saw sales rise 14 percent on a year to 191 985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194 301.
On its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat reported an 11 percent increase in sales to 140 083 vehicles, up from 143 536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also report sales below consensus, despite increases over a year of 8.8 percent and 15.2 percent respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM shares rose 1.6 percent at 16h35 GMT while Ford fell 1.2 percent.

A study designed to multiplier the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the British government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that the high speed services through Scotland and north England will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Transport Minister baritone Kramer said the project would "unite Britain."
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown was "excited" about working with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 will be completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised up the estimatical cost of building the high-speed link between London and north England, from £32.4 Md to £42.8 Md.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to consider strengthening rail capacity and improving the length of sentences for northern England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of travel durations between Glasgow and Edimbourg of three hours at a time.
Barbarter Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is to build a truly national network that will rapprocher Britain and its cities."
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are huge.
Without him, we are facing a capacity problem in our rail network.
But it is also to develop connectivité between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and EEdinburgh, so the liaisons between them are better through HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael said: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to support "without équivoque" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight into the overall proposed network of major rail network across Britain.
"We are now excited about working in partnership with the British Government so that we can consider options aimed at bringing the train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complying with the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Scottish Government is already set to plan.
"I am impatient to read the test report with British ministers next year and then decide together on the next steps."
UN welcomes new goals in aid fight
The United Nations will start working early next year on a new set of goals intended to replace the millénaire for Development (OMD) goals, which had been set 12 years ago to fight poverty around the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in developing "sustainable development goals" designed to replace OMD, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Conference on sustainable development that began last night in Rio de Janeiro.
They included the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the weekend that it was now time to "surpass national interests."
"I am pleased that member states have agreed to start and approprier the process aimed at setting universing sustainable development goals (ODD)," he said.
These ODD will build on the progress made as part of the millénaire for Development goals and will be part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do the best to accede to the mandate that has been given to me by member states to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals which are based on the success of OMD.
Parents of intersexuzed children can choose "indéterminé sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for nourrissons born with ambigüous sex organs.
The male or female sex of the new born will no longer be awarded them, in a rigide way, at birth.
As part of the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child's sex, allowing them to register an "indéterminé" or "unspéciable" sex "on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure that was on parents who could make rushed decisions regarding sexual reassignation surgery for their nourrisson, and to fight discrimination at intersexual-sex people.
To the BBC, an intersexual-sex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that doctors created, contusified and balding.
We estimate one child out of 2,000 born each year, is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexuzed, with intersexuality making up the group of the soixantaine of diseases diagnosed as disordered sexual development, a generic term dissignant people possessing chromosomes or gonades (ovaries or testicules) atypiques or anormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexualized.
sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the U.S. say that when sex can't be determined, it's best to use the best information available to award it, then wait and track the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, the following day.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist in sexual identification issues, said the new German law "seems to be a good idea."
Interintersexuated children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical act, but that is not the case of most children," he said.
It is possible to make a sexual assignation without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science that involves how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very specific.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery surrounding homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersexuals as different from transsexuals or transgender people, although their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is either exclusively one man or exclusively one woman, but is in general both in the past and not clearly defined as being one or the other.
These characteristics can show themselves in the secondary sexual traits, (such as muscle mass, pilosité, chest and stature), primary sexual traits (such as reproducteurs organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also gave a glimpse of the discrimination to which intersexualized and transgender people were subjected in employment, as well as the scale of incidents of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by stereotypes.
The boy boys of non-conforme sex now have camps that are specifically aimed at them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 51-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized "neutral" after winning her appeal in the court that allows her to keep a "non-spécified" sex life.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F - X for intersexuals, according to the Home Office.
In neighbouring France, genre issues still face controverts, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, douzaines of laws in this foncièrement Catholic country signed a petition for the "théorie of genres" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed German law, writing that "although the world is trending into a new era where genre is a choice but sexual activity is not one, we renounce two other piliers of civilisation."
In Maryland, the mother of a nourrisson also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be awarded to babies at their birth.
"The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, in particular if you don't know your child's sex," she said on the site aimed at young parents.
Children have to have stability and certitudes.
Historiquement, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrodite, of course, the name of the beautiful Greek dieu who had a double sex.
And just a few years ago, the medical community regarded the genre as an ardoise, which you can erase and on which you can redraw.
But now, many are those who back the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors can erreur, not knowing how a child will experience his sexual reassignation when he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, we called this a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When those children naissent, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we would phone the surgeon.
The dominant theory about how to treat children armed with ambigüous sex organs was launched by Dr. John Money, of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the genre maudlin.
He devoted the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals - the way parents raise a child - interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so it can be identified as being of male or female sex.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John / Joan," his theories gave way to controverses.
He had advised parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut out during a bâcling circoncision to get him fully cascaded, also enlargement his testicles, and raising him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that wasn't the case," Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he rebecame a boy and married with a woman.
But at 38, he killed himself.
Drescher said some doctors "always repeat that model."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say "[that] they are not satisfied with the result."
Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a 38-year-old Montana writer, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambigüous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn't really tell if he had a wide clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he might never have a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So little after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical ablation of the external kidney and testicles and was raised as a girl.
We got her to take female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18, he underwent vaginoplasty.
But dismayed and finding out something was not going away, he sought out his medical record.
What he discovered horrifies him.
I was stérilisé at birth - and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a désordre of sexual development (DDS) which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to grow.
After learning the truth, he rebecame a man, following a testosterone-treatment and got her breasts removed.
The surgery made him stérile.
Today he is promoting the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersexuals.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the nonprofit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "encourages étiquetage and stigmatization."
"As many as 30 activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an 'indéterminé' sex," she said.
We have to fear it encourages interventions.
We think it would be better to award a male or female sex, and wait.
But we haven't seen what the law was going to give, so we can only move up theories.
Tamar-Mattis said his organization supported the Australian law because "it permits adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex appellation."
"adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind of thing," she said.
German law covers the allocation of sex at birth.
This is a battle young children should fight at this âge-là.
When they grow, they will be able to make decisions regarding their own body.
But Dr. Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammographies in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from sexual désordre and helps thousands of people in a support group, said German law "responsabilizes" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has DDS called a syndrome of complete insensitivity to androgen.
Because of the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no utterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and an internal specialty in infantile psychiatrie at Pennsylvania State University.
Although she is stérilic, she hopes to have children through adoption services or mères porteuse.
"The law leaves some latitude to parents to ensure they don't have to make any rushed decisions," Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a time before they register "male" or "female."
Instead, everything goes well - you can raise your child and love it.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the fun of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for a surgical intervention that is irréversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and deflates the sense of anxiety that drives parents because they have to do what it takes," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he / she feels / most at ease - and that's something tremendous.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.

His gun was seized.
Obama cri of despair from Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change
He says Obama has made loudest efforts undone by Republican Party obstructionism
obstrucobstructionism doesn't excuse the Obamacare site's problems, or drones attacks
Obama memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University's faculté of medicine.
I'm going to read an affably sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosité of the 2nd year of medicine and redonnera me hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and it is the mémoires from Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I've finished my patients' medical comptals on the night and I wake up, this book remparts me to the time when policies were inspire millions of people and when speeches could cut you off.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and news coverage from news newspapers took time to think about the historic nature of the moment.
My classmates cried out and my parents retained all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was moving toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82 percent favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult réveil, it's like coming off a dream.
It is hard to remember those days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
This had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I put Obama's credit for great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (affordable care law) until the withdrawal from Iraq of our military, in passant by the end of "neither seen nor known" and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
As a result, I believe partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts aimed at bringing our nation forward in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly promoting Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide an explanation.
I am on the brink of political despair.
Republican obstruction can't explain the set of foreign leaders, or the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It can't explain that the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' private lives, or the prosecution of dénonciators that reveal government méfaits.
It can't justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without trial, or the escape of public financing and the dépassement of spending allowed during presidential campaigns.
It can't justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to reduce the media to silence are the "most agressives... since Nixon administration."
And, most recently, it can't apologize for the inability to design a simple Web site for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could counter the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the election function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, like Newton's massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be in large part the administration's choice.
That's what troubles me most.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented an confused and unraffled alternative that did not seem to help determine his policies or views.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term while freed from the pressure of future elections, would hold the promises that we had heard for so long.
Indeed, as the approval rating plunged below 45 percent this week, it is even harder to return to the 2008 year through this book.
He makes me wish me the many promises that have gone up.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses over Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primaires.
During an après-campaign meeting, he told his team it was important that they get back on track and stay loyal to their cause.
"I want us to recast our talent," he said.
We need to remind ourselves who we are.
We are 5 years after, Mr. President, and I am no longer of agreement with you.
The points of view expressed in this comment are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
The Nouvelle Star made a return, Côté audiences, with 1.4 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6 per cent share.
But was the show on the way?
Some 10 million applicants showed up for the auditions of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the méchant Sinclair, the perky André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On the page, viewers shared their comments.
Passfrom the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored in this first prime time.
Like every year, the first audition shows braid a wide choice of on-air singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Yet, on the account, you want show, emotion, originalité, music...
Fortunately, some of them found their way.
They are likely to have tried the Nouvelle Star, and sometimes even go back to the beginning.
Behind television screens, the rising singer's vocations are always there, season after season.
Many others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
RBS suspend two traders on currency market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division according to two sources close to the matter, which once again shows that regulators' global probe into suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the biggest banks in the world, notably UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators as part of investigations conducted on the largest financial market in the world, where $4.7 billion changes hands each day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation which is similar to the scandal over the interbank rate manipulations.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month it had received requests for information from regulators.
"The investigation under way into this is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators," a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month sources close to the case said that RBS had passed records of emails and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
That trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and may have been put suspended from his post as a senior European director of foreign exchange for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, a senior European director of foreign exchange trading at Citi, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of those traders has faced any charges.
Mr. Usher's case included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources familiar with the case said.
UBS said this week that it had launched action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspicions of market manipulation in a certain number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, Swiss concurrence authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Financial Services Authority - are reviewing allegations made involving bankers who were agreed to manipulate rates on the exchange.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources familiar with the matter said.
Banks épluchent instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of remedial acts.
News news regarding these investigations has shaken traders in an area that has been one of the biggest growth engines for investment banks' trading units over the past few years, but has been called into question this year because of low currency volatility that limits opportunities for spéculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the matter by saying it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast heavily liquid foreign exchange market, but seniors traders explain that is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that in spite of the high volume of daily currency transactions, fragmentation in liquidity between trading platforms and increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start to have an impact on the market at little cost."
The news came the day after Crédit Suisse said it had sent a trader working in his office of the futures traded on the London Stock Exchange this week after it caused a $6 million loss in late 2007.
The bank quickly notified relevant regulators and cooperate with regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the matter was contained," a representative of Crédit Suisse said.
Chinese paper that launched appeal "to be remaniated"
A Chinese paper that launched a first-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of diffamation will be remaniated, a press regulator declared.
The New Express based in Guangzhou has issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen by the time he spoke to television that he had accepted bribes to make stories over a semi-public company.
At present, the New Express will undergo a "complete remaniement," the regulator said.
The "remaniement" order came from Guangdon administration for the Press and Television, Radio, Film and Télévision.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect articles about the listed Zoomlion company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The New Express rédaction was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided "to impose a handed down administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to begin a complete remaniement of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the people responsible at New Express and immediately remanie the management team."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express about the alleged financial irregularities of a construction machinery maker called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his paper twice published a one-page appeal for his release, writing that it supported his journalism.
But Mr Chen later appeared on a public television channel where he admitted publishing false stories against money.
"In this case I have hurt Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to win public trust," he told the public television network CCTV.
I did it mostly because I was running after money and celebrity.
I was told of my mistake.
According to Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published its apology in the first page, writing that it had not properly checked its articles.
Several important suspects recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are routinely forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier in the year banning officials from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Obama makes headway on health care reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama yesterday returned to his no-ambiguïté and often repeated pledge that "if you are satisfied with your health care plan, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received résiliation orders from their contractors, Republicans have criticized the president over the past few days by accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people untenant health insurance that suits them can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "an effervescence in the news" over résiliations, President Obama encouraged Americans who received these advice to look for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to get complete and better health plans for the same price, or for even less than expected.
"You will come out winner," he said.
The Administration said that one should wonder if the 5 percent of the population who are actually contracing their insurance would find themselves forced to change their coverage because their coverage does not meet new standards required in violation of the Affordable Care Act.
"Permit me to speak directly to these Americans: You deserve better," Kathleen Sebelius said during her testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch in October of the online market had failed "lamentably."
"I'm as frustrated and irritated as anyone else," she said.
I have hâte to regain your trust.
It was a exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who delivered that phrase, as she believed her microphone was cut, speaking to an assistant sitting behind her during yesterday's General Assembly session following an exchange of litigious points with Billy Long, a Missouri Republican representative, to find out whether she should adhérer to Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long kept asking with insistance Ms. Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not deliberately gave up insurance sponsored by the government to souscrire a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now touts to millions of Americans.
Coen tribute to Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, the Grand Prize winner at the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that was just beginning to ring, before Bob Dylan's arrival.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmoLaurent is to make the objet of a retrospective at the French Cinémathèque, had raflé the Palme d' Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
At least able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have thrown their weight behind rising American film star Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this film filled with humor where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac proves to be an accomplished musician and folk singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
According to Carey Mulligan, she has left Daisy Mulligan's rich attics in "Gatsby the magnifique" for less reluisant clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the juror has débitted to the mitraillette when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells over a week of the tribulations of a folk singer who fails to percer and fretted with the whole land.
He accepts at reculons remplacements over the years in the studios.
Without housing, he's making the rounds of his friends' candies who want to still receive it.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is torturous, it was this that interest us: a mix of luck, a guy who isn't there at the right time, who isn't carrier-friendly but integrated, with self-destruct behavior," Ethan Coen, nominated with his brother Joel with several Oscars and awards at Cannes.
While Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two longtime folk music filmmakers built their story on real figures of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the arrival of Greenwich village, that New York City neighborhood expected to become "the épicentre of the growth of folk music that would generate international stars," as the BBC's Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk, writes.
The film then takes on documentary feel, from the poussières record label filled with 33T invades habitual occupied by an accented old secretary, to the musical choices of the earlier studios and the cafes where the singers performed.
Coen Coen's magic still operates by incorporating a funny character who crosses the film in the background: a beautiful roux cat with a crazed eye, Llewyn Davis's longtime companion.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had pointed out he had "grown up in Tennessee, baigned in blues and country."
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he had said.
For Justin Timberlake, while work is necessary to "be considered good," "luck can also launch someone's career," and "increasingly now."
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses any compromise on her music, the pop star explained that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get stuck by anything that can stop us from speaking."
Chevron, the nation's second-largest oil company, on Friday reported a drop in third-quarter profit because of lower refining margins, as its oil and gas production increased while staying in line with the company's targets.
Its third quarter net income declined to $3.95 billion, or $1.57 per share, from $4.25 billion, or $1.69 per share, a year ago.
Analysts polled by Reuters on average forecast earnings per share of $1.71.
The company produced 1.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up from 1.52 million bpd produced a year ago.
The Company is targeting 1.65 million bpd for this year, with 25% growth expected by 2017.
A major part of the growth in the years ahead will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual investment spending increased seven billion dollars in two years and is expected to reach $38.7 billion in 2013.
Earnings from production operations declined slightly in the third quarter, while profits from the aval operations (including refining and chemical production) fell 45 percent to $380 million.
This drop in refining margins affects the entire sector.
So Chevron's main rival Exxon Mobil on Thursday reported a lower net profit, despite higher gas and oil production.
The L.A. Times reported that an American Transportation Security Administration agent, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the gunfight.
Firefighters called to the scene of the crash said they had responded to a call making "multiple injuries."
"The forces are on the ground," the airport says on its official account, as television footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shootout," a spokesman for the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) told AFP.
ABC local news channel showed one person evacuated on a brancher, and a second taken on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9h30 local time (12h30 GMT in New York) at the airport's terminal 3, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times says teminals 2 and 3 are under evacuation.
The TSA spokesman was not immediately able to confirm in the immédiat whether one of its employees was hurt.
All flights at and from the airport were suspended.
Espionnage by NSA: US 'went too far', admits Kerry
The US has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged, in this first admission from Washington in the midst of a row with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After 10 days of scandal, revelations and démentis between the US and their European allies, it is the first time a government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will ensure that no longer happens at all," John Kerry said in a conference in London to which he was attending from Washington Thursday 31 October by video liaison.
In his retransmis address, in front of his British counterpart William Hague, the US leader longuement justified intelligence and intelligence collection practices as necessary for nécessaire antiterroriste and prevention against possible attacks.
Invoquant the 11 Septembre attacks, Madrid's attacks in March 2004 and London's ones in July 2005, John Kerry insisted that American officials had since déjoué numerous terror plans, through intelligence interception and intelligence collection.
"We have as a result prevented planes from falling, buildings would explode and people were murdered, because we were able to be on the ground in advance of these projects," the chief U.S. diplomatie official argumentated.
And, John Kerry said at the end of the week, "I assure you that in this process innocent people were not erreur."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far in an unsuitable way," admitted the secretary of state, who had previously had to speak about this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He insisted Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was carrying out a reinvestigation of these practices so no one would be mislead."
But controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to enrage this week with fresh revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA was intercepting data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The paper, which quotes documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Edward espie, says the program called "MUSCULAR," and conducted with the EU's equivalent, the GCHQ, allows those two agencies to retrieve data from the optics used by internet giants.
To be sure, one of the documents, some 181 million pieces had been collected over the last January - ranging from métadonnées on e-mails, to text elements or audio or video documents.
Those interceptions would have taken place in the US.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For 10 days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy, have revealed that the NSA has illegally intercepted data and communications from US allies and their leaders, particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced to anger from European states and as leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was not aware of such tapes, Barack Obama refused to speak on this, citing national security.
By contrast, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, has denied that his intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the blame to the European intelligence agencies who would have seized on those communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where those NATO allies cooperated with the US and that would absolutely not target Europe, General Alexander said.
And the row spread Friday to Asia.
Indonesia has summoned Australia's ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a massive international spying network that has also drawn the ire of China.
Puberty early: Views more early
Studies show that afro-American and hispaniAmerican young girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
physical changes do not mean puberty is imminent
Nothing evidence proves hormones or other chemical substances are responsible
Experts think obesity epidemic may be a déclencheur of early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced among boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and health issues in the child.
A mother should worry if her daughter's breasts and puffy pops start to push at 7 or 8?
During the American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference that was held this week in Orlando, Fla., Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pédo-endocrinologist, said these early early physical changes are fairly common among young Américaines and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time rassurer parents - in general, that doesn't indicate a rapid evolution to full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as bourgeoisie bourgeoons, pods under arms and in the puberty area and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the past four decades.
In the U.S., the average age is 12 and a half, while it was 12 and three quarts in 1970.
"Once the chest has started to grow, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
Time is the most precise test for how puberty will develop.
There is debate regarding what constitutes the actual appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when the development of the chest comes with sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops - something a pédiatre can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify tests done by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems like tumours or kystes.
There are treatments to delay the apparition of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging that can curb growth and small size at the adult age.
The recommendations in médicament-based and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, development rate, growth rate and affective maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with the drugs but acknowledges that "the fact of controlling puberty can atténuer some behavior problems and the sensation for young girls to be different from others."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents just don't want their very young daughters to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they'll handle hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It's been a shock," one woman whose daughter had her first rules at 10.
Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules, she wasn't prepared émotionally.
She returned from school frightened and shocked to be the first among her friends.
There are numerous theories brought to the public about the causes of early puberty.
Indeed, there is no consistent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemical products found in the environment or sexual messages expressed by the media are responsible.
boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible theory is that the obesity epidemic is.
He helped lead a study conducted on girls ages 6 to 9 that links the percentage of grasses mass to the start of puberty.
Other other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, afro-American and hispaniAmerican young girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explications.
At the same time, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, in passant by genes.
Another problem: Although boys have pops on their face and in the puberty area, the trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other other doctors attending the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubiens pods is common, even in nourrissons and tout-petits.
"We need to be cautious as to how we identify the true appearance of puberty," Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pédo-endocrinologist working at Goryeb Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, said.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pédiatre to find out how to talk with their child.
"This can mean having a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you reside calm down, your child will reproduce well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early need to be reassured about the fact that, even when it comes earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
A driver driving at 210 mph with hot drink between his legs has been given a £1,000 amber
A automobiliste has been given a £1,000 fine for driving at 210 mph with a hot drink laid in équilibre between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on 27 May.
When police arrested him, they discovered the drink to be carried between his legs.
At the High Court in Colchester, Howie admitted the offence of driving without the caution and attention required.
The seven points removed on his license led to a 6 month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs running to £90 and a surtax for the victim of £100.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to handle."
Entired in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team to film a Hezbollah protest, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was freed nearly 21 months later, on Nov. 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he helped in 2004 found the charity's "Otages of the World," which he has chaired for several years.
Its main goal: obtenir the chance for the hostages to bring charges and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Détenated more than 1 million days, the four hostages from Al-Qaïda (al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were freed Tuesday.
After medical tests at the military hospital in Val-de-Grâce Wednesday afternoon, they were able, since then, to find their families.
And try, little by little, to regain the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, an ex grand reporter, retired since 2008, president of the charity "Otages of the World."
From the night of your release, you were on the "Antenne 2" set.
What are your memories of your release today?
On place, particularly in Beirut.
When I am released, I sit in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Roger Auque.
He says "we're released," but I'm not sure, and tells me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very tense too.
It's war, and those who drive us are also very tense.
They drop us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian military personnel.
You then arrive on the site of the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
Français French bring us to the French Embassy.
It's the time of the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having been dining in a t-shirt at the UK Embassy.
I also remember a short night talking with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is always there because we don't have resources to evacuate us to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there in a helicopter, we take a private plane that brings us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did your arrival on French soil?
We atterrit at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.
It's a little brutal.
There's an amazing bousculade.
And a lot of media.
When I went there were three television channels.
I come back and there's lots.
The climb down the plane's stairs, the retrouvailles with my son and my parents, my friends, all that is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and home, many motorcycles follow our car Roussin drives.
The motards pull out the gun to make pictures and follow me up to home where I need a bit of police to stop some from climbing.
Media media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we are right to know it....
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see it.
You sort of get out of a hole and you're all under media spotlight.
It's a bit complicated, a little violent, quite complex to handle.
But we did the hard part.
The sock is over, the next day I'm on TV.
Commence then some kind of life rehabilitation, very doucement, for one or two months that are a bit like holidays.
How did the medical exams and DGSE debriefing?
I'd had a first medical check in Scotland.
The rest was done at Val-de-Grâce the following day: radios, in-kind exams and a meeting with a psychiatrist.
This is a session that does everything but you know you can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we're not delivered to ourselves.
It does have to be a procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the preneurs of otages.
It was logical.
It didn't gên me.
How did you react, today, to the release of the four Niger hostages?
I listen to what's being said.
The debate over rançons included.
Some things hurt me, others less.
I'm trying to make the most of the issues between my past as a hostage and my casquette as president of the charity "Otages of the World" which helps me put distance, and seems far more interesting to address.
I question by example the definition of résilience.
Moreover, I am fighting, with others, for recognition of the hostage's legal status.
There is according to me a sea-change problem.
It's important to call the hostage taking "political" - which is the case most of the time - and allow hostages to have access to justice, bring charges and bring their preneurs of otages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and réjouit about the release of these hostages.
But who says those hostages may perhaps have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is done for that.
Why wouldn't you tell the hostage preneurs "you violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, you're going to bring you to justice?"
It actually seems to me, legitimate, struck the right way.
That message is heard, but not listened to, and that chokes me.
That's my main fight.
Sixième annual Play Skateboard on Saturday in Hyères
The sixth annual Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday, 2 November at the skate park in Hyères.
Organised by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump charity, the competition is expected to include the region's best skaters.
registration are taken on Saturday morning at about 9 p.m. and qualifying phases start in the foulée, at 10 p.m., before the scheduled finale at 15 p.m. and the awards presentation at 16 p.m.
The audience will be able to admire the technical prouesses of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, at least in the hyped young tu Palumbo.
At just 10, he has already captured his place this year for the European championships in Copenhagen and he does nothing so much as replaying to competitors who exceed him by three.
The Wall of Wall Street's second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out some of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious Manhattan broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget't be reasonable and pull your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will unsettle you in his role as a depraved trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the real story of a "Long Island stock broker, who refuses to cooperate with the authorities as part of a massive corruption case on Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then monte an arnaque that will make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his amazing ascension, but also the vertiginous fall that followed.
Without limits, the man enchaîne parties, women, drugs.
Décadence and excess in any way are the maître words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had unis them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese took some time because of its too long montage.
It appears the film will ultimately last 2pm.
In the UK on December 25, he will be able to participate in the Oscar race.
The stock market closed lower Thursday, hurt by the poor results of Shell and on the back of an announcement by the Fed of continued support for the economy, as expected.
In La Seyne, relogement for rats turns out to be
In early May, a family left their apartment in the rez-de-chaussée of Fructidor D2 building, because of the presence of rats.
Given the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres office of South West Habitat, has proposed, in an unusual and provisoire fashion, reloger the couple and their three children in a neuf T4.
Indeed, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, the office's director.
Big rats, there have always been in cities.
The dératisation company makes two passages a year, and in turn we, at our expense, at every request of the residents.
We have so far, since the end of last winter, made 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not left to die, and rats aren't pullout in the city.
For public health and public health reasons, dératisation products are four times less effective than by the past, certes, but for two rats you're not going to kill a goddess.
"We did not invite rats home," insists the father of two who left his home to move to the hotel.
We are soon without the money and expect a new home, at the same rate as the old one.
Royal Bank of Scotland will in the future create a défaisance ("bad bank") structure representing 38 billion pounds ($45 billion) of the most risky assets, a move designed to détendre its relations with London and accelerate its repratisation.
The bank wants to cut from 55 per cent to 70 per cent the proportion of questionable assets in its balance sheet in the two years to come and hopes to have cleared this up fully within the next three years.
RBS also said it would include a provision for dépréciation of the extra £four billion to £5.5 billion over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantankate structure.
RBS also said that this internal restructuring would free up to £10 billion of capital, further strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London said the "bad bank" would help draw a line under the past, with the government in particular being accused of ingesting in RBS's management.
"We can now go forward, worry about the future and the 90 per cent of the assets that provide a really good bank and build a great bank for the customer and for the Kingdom," new chief executive Ross McEwan told reporters.
George Kerevan: Europe's éclatement gives Écossais choice
One other day, another troubling story of independence.
This time, we warn that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free trade zone to be able to join the EU.
And now we hear about passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbed wire the length of Hadrien's wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde paper has indicated the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this did not actually appear in the big papers (and that was to be expected).
No one else has said EU member states spend a great deal of their time bypass their formative rules when it arrange them.
Since Scotland does not make it to the Schengen area for the moment, continued breach of the rules would be a slim concession that Brussels could offer in return for all it wants to get from the Édevils.
It is now a story that is not one.
And an old story so old it is now figure-free: I heard for the first time the bobblehead that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
Indeed, we've forgotten an interesting point in this adaptation of a poussiéreuse old conte.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why trade London's joug for Brussels's, in particular now?
Here is the true news regarding Europe: the great postwar plan aimed at unifying Europe is permanently on the rocks.
With the euro crisis, the projet of European Union officially is dead.
At around Europe, parties that oppose the EU or are pushing for the introduction of the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptique Alternative for Germany, founded only this year and coming from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the September federal elections and pulled the Democratic Party (equivalent of our libérBertrand) from the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the proposed creation of a federal Europe.
Still, the current economic downturn has marked a turning point.
The sterity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the carrot weighing on national economies through membership of the single currency, led many people to think the projet Europe went too far.
The euro crisis doesn't have much to do with national governments that record excessive budget deficits - that was only true for Greece.
The European system has mostly brought on its members exchange rates favorable to German exporters - something German political leaders want to retain.
Without the possibility of a disvaluation of the national currency, countries in southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis of Germany.
The only recours is to make deep cuts in wages and public spending - encouraged by Berlin.
Aside from the current budget and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
Due to "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - which are a reason to subventionner French and German companies in the energy sector at the consumer's expense - the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as the United States.
It is a rédhiDE inconvénient in terms of costs, as we have already seen at Grangemouth.
All the pay gels in the world will not stop the European pétrochemical industry from being hurt by a good American gas.
In consequence, the revolt is grounding, in particular in France, one of the EU's major meneurs.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a collision course with Washington.
But Berlin no longer has to use Paris as its passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy set to disintegrate.
Résultat: Marine Le Pen's anti-European Front, the anti-European Front, is to win a crucial partielle election, moving the socialistes in power to third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - an opportun warning for the British Labour Party which reminds it that it can't go back to the principle that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with her new popularity with the French working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create an anti-euro and anti-European bloc within the European parliament.
If anti-European parties make good on these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European parliament for the first time.
Here's what I think: very soon, anti-European and anti-euro sentiment in Europe will unify and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like "the European Union (sovereign) Europe" free of the Great Britain favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will find their own currency.
I expect Britain to take its lead from this project, and I hope it will make the eyes out of the United States.
Still, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left for dead in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all that?
We can decide to be a small England region (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels.
I believe Scotland could cope with a more free European agreement at least if we garner our own motto.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe.
Otherwise we should copy Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is - and that is to be expected - the anti-rigueur political movement that has performed best in Europe, although it won a dramatic majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dire cuts proposed (and put in) by the Labour Chancelier, Alistair Darling, and the Tory / libérOffice coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the rigueur imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
House house the proie of flames in Vieux-Québec
A fire that started Friday afternoon in the Vieux-Québec area was quickly contained.
More than a couple of firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a three-bedroom house spread over four floors located behind the School District.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was contained an hour after the arrival of firefighters, who were quick to intervene.
Soon our first firefighters arrived, they really saw any apparent smoke.
"So the alms ran out, because it took help to attack the building, because it's buildings collared here," said France Loiselle, a spokeswoman for the New York Fire Department.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Spectacular fall in 'wingsuit' above Bogota
Sports sportif Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination complete with wings), it went 160 miles above the famous Monserrate shrine, located more than 3 million feet up, where many badgers had gathered to observe his achievement.
End of service for Elysée chef
Entré in the 500 m2 of élyséan kitchens as a commis after working in embassies, the cook gravitated all the échelons until becoming chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande in the 1990s, including on their vacation grounds, and fed an incalculable number of great people from this world in a near-anonymity he breaks only today, at age 60.
The man with an open face, ungarni crâne and glasses of intellectual property, born on October 24, 1953, at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin is titulaire of a degree in pâtisserie.
His mother was herself a chef in a château in Sologne.
"I went from one castle to the next!" joked Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It's always the chief executive or his girlfriend or wife who chooses the menus," he notes.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly in the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the Elysée kitchens!
Don't mind heads of state who displayed relative indifférence to the surface nourish, "they're all gourmands," ingly accusations Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had scrapped cheese, the assiettes came empty!
According to François Hollande, who restored cheese, "he's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like."
The current leader, who has regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific diet request."
Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, in particular during state dinner dîners at the Elysée: It's possible to serve "between 200 and 250 people in an hour or so."
The night that preceded is practically white.
These folks wouldn't understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the Elysée kitchens, who took a verre Tuesday evening with his team, family and friends, goes with a pincement in the heart. ".François Hollande came to greet me."
He said praise.
"His human side came out," he recalled.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who for example has been for dix-sept years at the Elysée.
A collision between two vehicles left four people injured early on Friday on Highway 131, Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4am, a motorist driving in the north direction, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car coming in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but one said they did not fear for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal around 6am on Friday.
Mayor Rob Ford's probe has been bâcled down, lawyer argues
After police confirmed they had set up a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack cocaine, Mr Clayton Ruby argued he had never seen such an "bâcling" investigation.
Mr Ruby said he believed to The Associated Press that police had "ignored or minimized" evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasion-looking driver, Alexander Lisi, now 35, and charged him with extorting money relating to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously charged with drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said they also observed that man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court papers indicate.
Mr Ruby described as "inexplicable" the fact that police have never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or put on his phone, arguing that police chief Bill Blair has chosen in due course not to act against the mayor.
In accordance with the law, police, having been témoin of suspicious transactions in clean hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and conduct a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requéralised an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but spokesman Mark Pugash called Mr. Ruby's comments an "obvious and desperate attempt" to get the media to know him in a case that hardly involves him.
In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair said there was nothing in that video that could provide "reasonable grounds" for the filing of a criminal indictment against the mayor.
One militant from Hamas' armed wing was killed that evening and another wounded by an Israeli char fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza said.
In those sources, those militants were leading a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they faced an mortar attack from an Israeli blindfolds.
German journalists urged to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday urged members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services on the back of fresh revelations about the activities of US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends journalists avoid until further notice using Google and Yahoo's search engines," it says in a statement.
It calls "scandalous" reports in The Washington Post, that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"The conducted by reporters are as confidential as their sources' coordonnées and the nature of their communications with them," said Michael Konken, president of the union which claims 36,500 members.
² room at the CGR in peerless hall evacuated Thursday night
Thursday night's first screening of a film was halted at the Méga CGR in peek out of peerless protest, following pickle-ups felt by audiences.
Immediately, the school's principal did carry out the evacuation of the room and warned firefighters for a suspicious smell.
70 people about came out of the session.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Mauvaise plaisanterie on fond of tear gas lacrymogènes?
Or an accidental incident?
Toujours est-il that the film's management has played the safety principle and safety of its customers down.
The room was aplenty and everything came back into order.
Film has been able to regain its rights and customers are finding the pleasure of images.

Explosion of house in Gesves: faulty gas stove at the scene
The grandmother allegedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion at a home in Gesves, which left two serious injuries Friday morning, a 53-year-old grandmother and her 7-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty gas station, the County Attorney's Office said Friday night.
The expert dispatched to the scene by the prosecution insists the cause of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette as there was a leak and an accumulation of gas.
The vital pronostic of the two victims is still being treated.
The grandmother was thrown by the blast and is seriously burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and girlfriend, was at his side and was burned more légèrement.
"The two victims were intuitized and longuement conditionally treated on the ground before being emmenées to the University of Liège, she in a helicopter, him in an ambulance," said bourgcommunal José Paulet, rising to the scene.
Traumatised, the grandfather was at the scene at the time of the blast.
Sent and well, he was able to reach the rez-de-chaussée through the door remaining intact while the front wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the landlord of the nearby house, fragilized by the blast, were relogés by the CPAS president.
Firefighters from Andalese and Namur and the Arches Police were called.
Crisnée's civil protection stabilised both buildings.
A black box in your car?
As the nation's highway planning planificators have struggled to find the money needed to repair the highway infrastructure in décrépitude, many of those who entreate a solution under a small black box that sets above your car's picture board.
The devices, which record all miles traveled by a motorist and pass the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to remanier the obsolete system of funding the major U.S. roads.
The area generally without interest in planning major roads suddenly caused strong debate and turbulent alliances.
The libertarians have joined environmental groups to press for the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you go, and eventually the road on which you circulez, then use the information to write a tax bill.
The Tea Party is despicable.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expressed concern regarding privacy protection.
And while members of Congress fail to come up with a figure to figure out whether it's time to continue, many states haven't waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to pass on a system allowing drivers to pay in order to reduce the number of miles driven.
Thousands of motorists have already embarqué these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental vibe.
This is really essential to our nation.
"It's not like we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governmental Affairs, which expects the state to begin recording the miles traveled by every California driver by 2025.
There's going to be change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes Americans pay at the pump, is financially at a loss.
Americans are buying as much gasoline as before.
The can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't increased in 20 years.
Political men are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, as gasoline prices are high.
"The gasoline tax is just not tenable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently brought tracing on 500 cars to test a payment system per mile.
"This proves to be the most logical long-term alternative," he said.
Wonks call that from use fees to kilométrage.
It is not surprising that the idea will appeal to citadel Democrats, although taxes could serve to alter driving habits in ways that help reduce encombrement and gas emissions, by contrast.
California's planificators care about the system because they develop strategies to reach the goals set in the state's ambitious climate laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
Supporters of the free market at the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of getting drivers to pay the mile.
"It is not simply a tax flowing into a large black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits that are available to them.
The movement is also backed by two former U.S. secretary of Transportation who, in a 2011 report, exhorted Congress to go down the path of the payment per mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have focused on about 10,000 cars.
But the House speaker killed the proposal, meeting the concerns of rural législates representing voters who must travel many miles every day to get to their work or in town.
Many states and large cities nonetheless are making progress on their own.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the nation's largest experiment.
Those motorists will soon pay the state for kilometer-related fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already led a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is trying a trial on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transportation in states serving the eastern U.S. coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could put the change into effect.
The concept is not universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned the government could follow their moindres facts and gestes.
"The over Big Brother concerns and that kind of thing are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
This is something people want.
From the start of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into one-stop localisation schemes."
It is not necessary to build a massive and encombrante technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to retain tapes of people's daily allées and venues.
Nevada is among the few states that are now discounting affordable technology that would allow the state to figure out how many miles a car will drive, but without knowing the location or excruciating time.
If we can do that, Khan said, citizens will be more at ease.
Research research for this technology prompted some state agencies to make use of a small California start-up of the name True Mileage.
At the time, society did not intend to help motorists pay taxes to the states.
It was looking to percer into the emerging auto insurance market, in which drivers would pay in order to meet their kilométrage.
But the devices she tweak have appealed to planning planificators on major roads because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded périodiquement by modem.
"People will be more willing to do that if you don't enregistreuse their speed and don't localize them," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive officer of True Mileage.
More big mistakes were made in some states' pilot programs.
There are far less expensive ways and far less intrinsic methods of proceed.
In Oregon, planificators are trying the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have an device off the market, preferring at the same time to pay a fee based on the average number of miles traveled by all state residents.
Other other states hope to sell the concept to misinformed citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not.
In the city of New York, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxation scheme that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide a "payment to the driver" insurance and create a data ensemble of on-time traffic in the form of other drivers drivers may use to avoid embouteillages.
"Drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," a document on urban planning said.
Still, some transportation planning planificators wonder if all the debate over the mile is simply a massive diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's San Francisco Bay area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the Highway Trust Fund's bankruptcy by increasing gasoline taxes.
A single or additional tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicles drivers and on others whose vehicles don't consume much gasoline, of which each pays their fair share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when you just have to take aspirin," Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs with the commission, said.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a tas of other things.
British police dispel extradition warrant to Assange
British police have issued an extradition warrant today to the encontre of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who fled to the Équateur Ambassade in London and applied for political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a "bail" notice to the 30-year-old Australian, asking him to turn himself in to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradé to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausted all possible channels in accordance with British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he interred against his extradition at the start of the month.
Craignant Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Équateur Ambassade in London on June 19, seeking that country from southern America political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "issued a bail order to a 30-year-old man who is asking him to turn up at a police station, on the date and time of his choice," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate conditions on his release on bail.
The Ambassade declined to comment on issuing the notice by police.
Assange fears he could be extradé from Sweden to the United States where he could be charged with spying, after revealed more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website battling secret information.
attconfident in longevity of his government
Italian President Enrico appposition says his government will hold until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition ahead of the Senate vote to dispel Silvio Berlusconi from office.
In an interview with La Stampa newspaper, the left-leaning leader says he has "firmly the intention" of continuing to govern with his coalition until the upcoming 2015 parliamentary elections.
Italy's upper house of Parliament will meet in the next month to decide the fate of the former president convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, votes for its destitution.
But a section of his party, regrouped around National Peuple (PDL) secretary general Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 by his refusal to yield to injonctions from Berlusconi who previously wanted to bring down the cabinet.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been at the same time finding strong discontent from the people I meet: monstrueuse revaluation of their properties, tax dearth, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative fees to no end.
So, siphoning no limit from our pockets.
Millions of dollars dilapidated could be spared so that much respectful taxation of those paying.
Any money being given out to taxpayers reduces their consumer freedom and contributes to their appauvrisement.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major businesses, we don't mind about the somptuary spending and maintenance of boatyard canals: déficitaire cultural center, high grant to the Cité of the Énergie, etc.
If those facilities are not profitable, whether we ventize them to private equity or we demolish them.
It is navnouveau also to constater the expropriation of several properties so that a major industry has never come to an end.
I also give honorable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to the tax payors?
It is not to the public pals to invest in such companies, but rather to the private sector by drawing on consumer demand.
Residents were pleased to learn that the Lake and Piles lacs will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
Following the departure of all industries (major water consumption) and the great decline in population, water use has declined significantly across the board.
Without mean to waste it, the city will never miss water and the harsh regulation as to its use could be greatly eased.
In summary, it is far easier to achieve great things with others' money.
I would have to defend such a record.
With a brute debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a stash without going through a bond settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by cravings with fine degrees for most and I do not believe a sheep élevator does worse.
travailleurs worker dies enseveered under concrete blocks
A construction worker died enseveered under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in New York City.
The shooting occurred about 11 a.m., on Marquette Street, just outside the intersection of Beaubien Street, in Rosemont-La Patrie.
By any vraisemblance, work being done on the foundations had been taking place at this time.
A mitter-like foundation wall was about to be erected over the past few days.
The accident happened at the same time the victim was about to arrive on the site so that he could retrieve his tools.
I passed in and saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, "said Sylvain Jean, who remains next door to the project.
I arrived and went to remove the big briques that covered it.
We saw just a part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
To authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his late 50s who worked for a coffeehouse business.
Medical réanimation manoeuvres were attempted by emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
A Health and Safety Executive inspector has been dispatched to the scene so that officers can investigate the circumstances surrounding this shooting.
NSA puts out 'internal error' and not computer pirates for website panne
The National Security Agency operating in the dark said Friday that it was a bug that had caused the panne of its public site for hours, and not hackers as some had claimed online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for hours that night because of an internal error that took place during a planned set of work," the spy agency said in a statement by email.
The problem will be solved that night.
The allegations that the panne was due to a distributed denial of service [DSD] attack are false.
Earlier that night, online servers trackers noted that the NSA site had been on a down for at least 6 hours, and some users still can't access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not part of the deal."
No classifying information is in danger, said the spokesman.
At least one group of online hacktivistes said it was responsible for the NSA site's panne by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until servers are overrun and the site collapse.
The cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the targeted system.
The once ultra secret NSA, a time dubbed the "No Such Agency," has been under scrutiny and heavily criticized over the past few months following a wave of revelations about its vast surveillance programs at the national and abroad - which are among the classified data of the NSA stolen from the agency and divulged by the former CIA consultant Edward espie.
This growing controversy over the agency has caused much speculation that this evening's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Centre-Ville Hotel closed its doors Thursday in New York City, after 36 years of operation.
The private equity firm that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student homes.
Three hundred cinquante people worked at the hotel.
Of them, 200 still have not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Other employers came to meet employees directly on the job, we met individually with employees to assess their needs.
"This support-là will continue for the next six months," said Delta Hôtels regional director of labor relations, Félix Bisson.
The closing of the Delta comes in a highly competitive hotel market.
The private equity firm that was the owner of that bâtison-building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the bâtisse to continue operating it, meaning there were investments of tens of millions of dollars so the competition is very fierce, there are a lot of new hotels that have emerged in New York.
"Or either he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," said Paul Arsenault, a titulaire of the Transat tourisme Chemistry at the School of Public Health.
Other other New York hotels will also be converted in the coming months, such as Crown Plaza which will become a home for the elderly.
Meanwhile, four hôteliers projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will see the light of day by two years.
Do you have to have a fluffy ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the first fluorescent ice in the world using méduse.
Charlie Francis pulled off the marine animal's fluorescent properties to develop a luminous collation.
He got the idea after reading a study on méduses and persuaded Chinese scientists to chimically recréer the bright protein.
The ice cream responds with the tongue by increasing the protein's pH to make it shine.
Chris explained that, although ice cream starts to lug when it responds to the heat of the mouth, the more you lift, the more bright it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I' m Delicious," said: "It's something amazing but we are still only in the early stages in terms of production, and 2 g of that stuff costs about £200."
The protein we use in ice réagit with the pH with neutral pH.
So when your mouth warm the protéine, the pH increases and the ice gets to shine.
We tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with all at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary bright effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've created because the méduses' luminescence is worth four times as much as gold.
Every boule now costs me about £140.
But it has rather good taste!
Charlie company with Charlie's experimental move, based in Bristol, is known for its unsettling ice parfums such as beer, cheese, bard and gold feuille.
But his next creation is expected to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really would like to develop an invisible ice."
It's intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice cristals that comprise ice cream, but I think I will find a way to do that.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the médule synthétised by Chinese scientists.
seriously serious in crash with ghost driver on Brussels ring
A road accident left a serious injury on Friday morning around 5am on the inside ring of Brussels at the centre of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is indemne.
The ring was closed off, until 9am, at the scene of the accident, the time the road was cleared and an expert determine the circumstances of the accident.
That situation also hardly caused any embouteillages because the accident took place at the Hoeilaart Road.
Traffic was able to be dévied by this exit / entry of the ring.
Boy seriously hurt in attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old was seriously injured following an accident on an attraction at Disneyland Paris.
His vital pronostic is no longer engagé but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat in the "Pirates of the Caribbean" attraction.
It has been closed until further notice.
Edward is ready to 'cooperate' with Germany on US surveillance issue
Edward Edward espie, the US intelligence chief, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr. Manning Thursday in Russia, where he receives the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the lawmaker presented to the media in Berlin Friday, Mr. somber said: "Although the result of my efforts has been of any kind positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to punish political rhetoric with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. somberti wrote that he thought the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges being filed against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Edward Manning is willing to talk to German officials, we will make sure that is possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany have been put to a rude épreuve following complaints that the NSA had put on the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the lawmaker who heads the congressional committee supervising foreign intelligence, said that while there was a chance to hear Mr. Manning as a witness "without putting him in danger and totally ruining relations with the United States," it was important to use it.
Mr. Ströbele, a German Green MP, posted a photo of him with Mr Manning on his own account.
During his visit to Russia, he was joined by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer for the former NSA consultant, Mr. Manning might not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. somer testified in Germany, it would be hard to give him the assurance that he would be "safe" there, the lawmaker said.
Mr somer wrote in his letter that he had faced a "serious and sustained persecution" campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
Still, he said he had been encouraged by the global reaction to "my act of political expression."
citizens world citizens as well as senior officials - including in the United States - have ruled that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public benefit.
The letter raises an offer of cooperation with German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."
A team of biologists led by the New York Wildlife Conservation Society has identified a new species of bosse off Australia's septentrial coast.
Thibaut Bouveroux, a scientific project manager at the Observatoire for Conservation and Etude of Animated and Milious Marches (OCEAMM) reports for The Times on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Will discovery of this new species of bosse do you surprise?
That's a good thing, but that doesn't particularly surprise me.
While by the time of the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomique and geographic basis, today's development of new tools such as genetics help us improve our knowledge of species classification.
It is of course impossible that these advances in genetics and moléculary biology call into question the classification or belonging of an species to a genre, family, or even order.
In the early 1920th century, morphologists classified the animals, on the basis of morphological differences between the species.
Today, some of these rankings are being turned down because of the progress in genetics.
In the same way, two very close morphologically related species have been distinguished through genetics.
That's the case of the new species that is about to be identified.
A few years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this underclass: Pacific fin dauphins and Atlantic bosse.
The recent analyses have helped distinguish four species.
Why is it an important discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society has said?
From a conservation point of view, it is vital to know these genetic differences, so that the species can protect its species and therefore its genetic variability.
While this population was already known for years by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, found only at that location.
From then on, if a massive mortality problem caused by a virgin outbreak or accidental capture takes place in the region, we may have to deal with the extinction of one species, rather than a local demise of a species more widely common on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
One species is considered threatened or in danger of extinction in order to count the number of existing individuals on Earth, which is stock, and whether it has to recover using nearby supplies.
For what's more, Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species being discovered, its stock automatically became weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
The mammals are located in the middle of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This brassage of genes limits the creation of new species.
At the same time, the more closed écosystèmes encourage genetic isolation, which can mean at least the creation of new species.
It's clear that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, than find out what lives in the Mariannes ve, just 11 miles from the sea surface.
We spend more money on life research on other planets than marine research and it is great time for that to change.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
billionaire MP Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters may be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining extraction magnate, who is challenging the payment of a carbon tax of a $6 million, made that argument to try to rule out issues involving a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial at the time of deciding whether carbon and mining taxes need to be scrapped.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr Abbott's daughters were prepared to benefit personally from these policies.
"He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying the parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in the fact that she or not get a leave," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the election commission officially declared that Mr Palmer won Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes, after recompiling.
Mr Palmer has advanced the idea of a remaniement of the death penalty system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
This election should be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We have to have a better system," he said.
Why can't you have a system in which you can enter, seize your coordonnées in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6am the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper crayons to mark the ballot papers.
Is to be able to erase the result if someone isn't of agreement?
Of our days, having a paper crayon seems extraordinary.
The Election Commission has studied possible options in terms of electronic voting and recently released a joint planning document with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties "very seriously."
The exercise of public office is a matter of public service.
"We are not seeking a reward, excepting the reward of history because we need to serve the community at a critical time," he said.
When many expert in équestres events gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Cheval of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be rude.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a 4-year-old.
Not yet at school and only months after making his first armes, the tout-petits and his Shetland Toffee trotted for the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable - who are of the same size - were praised for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual contest which was held at the Sunnybank équestre centre, Rudry near Cardiff.
standing against men and women in élégamment white melons, he wore his plate cap a bit on the side in a disco-shaped manner to bring his pony Toffee's 2-year-old pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by judges for his natural dressing-skills unmatched for a child his age.
And Toffee received very good marks for his presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee in for his 3rd birthday in March and has trained since with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee make an excellent pair."
They ran against and against all, but both raflé the silver and the rosette.
It was only the second time he concourted with Toffee and we were excited about it that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phénoménal they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy, from Nantyglo village, near Ebbw Vale, south Wales, is following the example of his tante Sharon Howells, who has been competing in équestres contests for more than 10 years.
Mrs Howells said: "There was electricity in the air and everyone encourageched him and applauded him."
He traveled all the length of the track running and even though he seemed to be all around, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is a crazy animal - he loves horses, ute and rural world and has two pouches that he cares for.
In the way he started, he will surely soon attend the Cheval of the Year event - and I'm sure he will make a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual équestre event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They are forming a good team.
The judges noticed Fenton and Toffee were showing well and how they walked down the track.
They seek an effective team work between the pony and dressers - Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his fine clothes helped Fenton, he really had fière allure.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson stressed that the wounded soldiers were not being somber released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and said a transition process was being followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attaked by Democrats and néo-démocrates in the House, Mr. Nicholson insisted that before their release, members of the military would follow a transition plan in conjunction with their bosses.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care in order to return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of trying to save money by not allowing wounded military personnel - who do not meet the Army's "universality" rule requiring that staff be able to perform a series of diverse tasks - to reach the 10-year move-through period required for retirement benefits.
They included two cases reported by The Associated Press, including one of a soldier released last Friday.
Cpl. David Hawkins, a London, England, réserviste with post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the Army despite his request to stay a year longer so he could receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case came after that of Cpl. Glen Kirkland, who told a congressional panel last month that he had been pushed toward retirement before he was ready because he did not meet the service's universality rule.
Mr Hawkins said a soldier could be prepared to go, with plans and consultation sessions, but that was completely different than the fact of wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with The Associated Press Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the military has struggled to determine what latitude it can grant to wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks, but who are not apologetically able to fight.
In accordance with current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas déploiements, they can be forced to leave the military.
Data presented last year to parliament indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required service period to get pension benefits.
Liberal spokesman Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday asked for the reintegration of Private Hawkins, while néo-démocrate Jack Harris demanded the immediate end to "this honourable practice."
Raid ground attack on military installations in Syria
To the Lebanese military, Israeli planes entered Lebanese air space Wednesday in early afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargaison of SA-8 SA-8 missiles may have been targeted and destroyed.
That new Tsahal air raid in Syrian territory (the sixth since the start of the year, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz) was confirmed either by Israel or Syria.
The raid was in circumstances at least similar to the one that had taken place on July 5: At the time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not caché their irritation at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to respond.
Prison life for former Chinese vice-governor
A former vice-governor of Jilin province, in northeastern China, was sentenced Friday to life in prison for corruption.
Excliled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of receiving more than $19 million in bribes, Chinese state media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also the chairman of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and officials secure contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing's top intermédiaire court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office in March, has made fighting corruption a national priority, saying the phenomenon posed a threat to the Communist Party's existence-free existence.
While the prime minister promised that justice would be as intraitable with the powerful "tigres" as with the "mouthpiece" - subordinate officials - only a handful of senior officials have been convicted, among them former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most dramatic recent case was that of the former PC chief in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in prison in September for corruption and abuse of power after he targeted the highest positions within the state.
But the government has hardly expressed the intention of reform the corruption system by by means of creating an independent party body.
Bombardier profit down, as orders and aircraft orders decline
Bombardier Inc, the Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer, reported a 15 percent fall in its net profit Thursday, amid the pressure of lower orders and aircraft shipments in the third quarter and contrasting problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in New York, did not provide any in-flight test data for its all-new CSeries plane or information permettant to know whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule for commercial service before September next year.
After the inaugural flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago, this one flew only three times, and the question then asked whether the test phase was in good order.
Results results were not up to expectations and shares fell 8 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating, from "overperformance" to "sector performance" because of the market's weak potential for rising stock prices over the next quarter or two quarters.
"Although the drop in aircraft deliveries has been in large part anticipated, we are really disappointed by the operating margin in the Transport division," Cameron Doerksen said in a note to clients.
We think Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries planes over time as the in-flight testing program moves forward.
Still, while no new orders are announced over the next few months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family of planes will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for the CSeries planes is modest so far at least 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight testing to confirm the Company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and potential savings of the new Boeing jet.
At the current time, the Company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, chairman and chief executive, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 fermes orders before the commercial launch of the first plane.
The executives also reassured analysts and media Thursday by indicating that the program was moving according to the schedule.
"The test plane did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Mr. Beaudoin said in a telephone conference, adding that ground trials and logicielles set up were planned during the plane's time frame.
Each automaker is planning in a different way.
We had decided to proceed with a first flight and plan a set period, and that's what we did.
This will happen all over the flight programme.
The second of the five test planes is expected to fly in the weeks ahead, with the others followed soon after, the company said.
Indeed, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer can get a CSeries plane flying just 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier said it was in the process of evaluating the early launch schedule and will provide further information over the next few months.
"This speed of in-flight testing - although it is apparently consistent with Bombardier's internal schedule - strengthens our opinion that the launch will be delayed in the first quarter of 2015," Mr. Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Earnings per diluted share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues fell slightly to $4.2 Md.
Analysts were expecting a profit of 10 cents per share and revenues of $3.56 Md, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The fourth largest aerospace manufacturer in the world said it had delivered 45 planes in the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 planes, up from 83 previously reported.
The delay in the Aéronautique division represented $34.3 Md at September 30, a figure unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aéronautique, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the weak number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," Mr. Beaudoin said.
Aéronautique revenues dropped 13 percent to reach $2 Md.
Bombardier, the largest rail manufacturer in the world, said revenues from that division had increased nearly 11 percent to $2.1 Md.
The carnet order for the Transport division totalled $32.8 Md at September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
Transport margins in the Transport division suffered from the execution problems involving some big contracts.
The said further indications would be provided in the fourth quarter.
The stock price of Bombardier, which also said Patrick Pichette, Google Inc chief financial officer, would serve on the board, fell 8.5 percent to $3.83 Canadian dollars in afternoon trading Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest aerospace manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, said Thursday a 10 percent drop in third-quarter profit.
kenpress Amorim Amorim criticism of controversial media law
"It's an effrayant country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: What will prevent parliament from balking at the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" the paper said in challenging the draft and asking that it be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is dracupon and very punitive, and we oppose it," said Cyrus Kamau, chief executive of Capital Group - owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent news stations and news Web sites in Kenya.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be partial because it is a extension of the government" and that restrictions relating to content and advertising would hurt Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it to lawmakers," he said.
To The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have "the hold on the media." The Standard, meanwhile, said democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and denounced the draft law as "draconienne."
The of the draft law comes in the same time as a train of measures aimed at boosting national security in the wake of the attack committed by armed Islamic militants in Westgate shopping centre in September.
The African media have sparked the authorities' anger by broadcasting footage from CCTV cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack supposedly stolen the luxury shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by convoking two journalists and a media official to question them, although the convocation was withdrawn following a growing storm of protests in the media.
In accordance with the new law, the media will be able to face fines of up to 20 million kenyans and journalists up to 1 million with the added risk of being "radiated" or failing to receive official press accréditation.
The court also has the power to seize a content-fee if this did not pay his fine.
To the Daily Nation, "even a single fine suffit to paralyze most FM stations."
He also says the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "active blogosphere."
By reducing the media to silence, political men know they can do what they want in any impunité.
"Nobody one will ever know," Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, wrote, describing the kenyans media as a key source of control in public life.
"Livred to themselves, the political men would put the country in bankruptcy and bring us to hunting and cueging."
kenlaws have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took up the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their mix-up salaries of about 532,000 shillings a month exempt from tax - which rank among the highest in the world.
Two spiders ages 23 and 27 had been missing in a lake under the Dent of Crolles since Thursday evening, officials said Friday from the Isère Spéléo rescue service.
They were localized on this vendredi-hour.
The two men, one aguerri at practice and the other not, had gone under Thursday about 21h30 so they could make a crossing from the Dent of Crolles, located on the town of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had then been without news of them since then, the same source said.
"The spillover should have come out at around 5am," Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the Spileworkers in charge of the rescue organisation, said.
Dozens of people on the ground
A number of rescuers, 10 civilian members of the French Spéléo rescue team, as well as police, CRS and firefighters were on the scene.
In late afternoon on Friday, the two spiders were localized.
"It was another group of spiders who, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the cave-in, passed the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network" said Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13e Chasseurs alpine in Chambéry, were found "exhausted, but not injured."
They ran into the network, returned to their feet waiting for rescue workers, the préfecture said.
Refed, they are expected to emerge from the cave-in with help from rescuers in the evening.
Auresident Aubervilliers launches his Parti for the City
Don't worry especially.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the Class" does not appeal solely to banlieusards.
I chose a UK map as my logo, "he reasons.
When I talk about suburb, I speak to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
It is not that his project, presented Thursday in a news conference in his home town of Aubervilliers, was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, that great cultural melting pot that avant all the neighborhoods.
My No. 1 proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, now claims to be "100 percent apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 at the expense of Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he later backed locally against Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I promote in my programme are railed down to Labour but if the people of the right are willing to support me, I will also listen to them, "he added.
There are only the extremist parties I don't talk to.
Besides multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune built his programme -consultable on Internet- using many themes supposed to speak to the residents of the suburbs and particularly young people: the right to vote for foreigners, legalisation of cannabis, civil majority at 16, rehabilitation of the office position...
Reste to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political stage ".For the 2014 local elections, that is likely to be fair, he acknowledges."
It's a time and money problem.
The Labour Party should kind of be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune insists he already has seven top candidates in France métropolitaine and Martinique.
"And the phone mails I've received since yesterday don't come from all of the suburbs," he agrees.
Vibrant tribute paid to former combattants in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military officials, as well as numerous patriotically related associations, paid a tribute on Friday afternoon to the soldiers and défunts from all wars.
Des germs were laid in two of the three military carrés of the cemetery by député-maire Jean-Claude Guibal and various celebrities.
Foreign workers in possession of 457 visa may have to pass' authenticity 'test
The government is currently considering whether to put in place a "proof of authenticity" test aimed at foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa as it considers extending the crackdown.
The test, if passed, would be implemented under a criteria intended to prevent 457 visas from being used to hold unskilled jobs or as a détourné way to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's rhetoric on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The fracassant statements about 'foreigners returning over the top' and 'jobs for Australians first' are a disheartening return to the time when unions were seeking a protected labour market," she told Australia's Australia Institute today.
Historiquement, that meant that whites' work needed to be protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if some countries in the region see it as an echo of that historic ark.
The document makes up 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O' Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials so that he could discuss human trafficking, put forward five of the reordered changes, the others pending review.
If the "authenticity" criteria were adopted, a visa recipient could be controlled to find out "whether the job offer is authentic in the case that the candidate is a relationship or a personal associate of the owner or the person concerned within the company that sponsorizes it."
Companies may also be required to declare the number of 457 visas after some of them, having had the intention of sponsorising a small number of workers, in fact employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old sri-lankled asylum seekers may have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's affable son, now 9, was traveling to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death Wednesday from an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred out of hospital by Australian-based authorities to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Remise issue in abortion right in Texas
A federal appeals court has restored in Texas some restrictions on the right to interruption of grossesse that had been blocked by a top court judge this week.
That ruling means a bill passed in July in that state and largely turning down the right to abortion will be able to go into effect.
The order issued by the court means that doctors who practice IVs will have to have a "admission privilege" from local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is a physician's right, in accordance with his status as a member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical center so that they can issue a diagnosis or treatment.
IVG advocates are arguing that the content of the law is likely to result in an immediate closure of a third of the state's clinics because those clinics failed to get that "admission privilege" for their praticiens.
In total, it would be nearly 20,500 women who would be denied access to those schools.
Monday, a top judge had said at the time of the law's passage that provisions dealing with the admission privilege were anticonstitutionally illegal.
But Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is seeking the governor's seat, asked the court to cancel the first-Circuit ruling that bloated the implementation of the law.
A plénière hearing on this issue is scheduled for next January.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the pay proposal for founder and chief executive Larry Ellison, given his company's financial performance.
The vote is not binding but comes to ternate the image of Larry Ellison, the world's third-biggest fortune just days after his boat won the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25 percent of the software company he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year already, Ellison had faced a negative vote on his pay.
The Oracle chief gave up a $1.1 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May because of the company's poor performance, but he earned about $77 million related to stock-options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
For the full year décalé 2013, Oracle's net profit rose 3.5 percent as the stock price surged 26.5 percent, outperforming the S & Guberger index which rose 24 percent in the same period.
Tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have turned out to be negative, the health ministry said.
He says that "the two cases identified in May 2013 now remain the only two confirmed cases in the UK to date."
Tuesday, this 59-year-old patient had been believed to be infected, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed a cinquantaine of people.
The 24-year-old top model does not start his film career through the small door.
Director Lars von Trier has chosen her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama eviscerates, in eight chapters that will come out in two volets (Jan. 1 and Jan. 8, 2014), the érotiques memories of a quadragénaire accented to sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her aînée is striking: a brash silhouette, diaphane teint and franco-angled French origins.
Never mind a certain taste for risk: one who hadn't hésité to pose naked on glaring paper will appear in far more sulfureuses situations on grand scale.
A extrait of Nymphomaniac has brought the temperature up on the Internet: Stacy Martin appears at bed and in full extender with Shia LaBeouf.
While the provocateur filmmaker asked his actors to put their pudeur behind, he had to use X professionals for the most osmée sex scenes, before combining all the numbing bodies: above the belt, he's the star; au-dessous, doublure.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, in addition to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has to push his actrices into their final retranchements, always for the better.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished making it.
Five years ago already my father has disappeared from the world of the vivants.
At the beginning I denied his death, I was talking about him at the present,
I had so much fear of forget him or rather I didn't know how I'd keep "dating him."
There is no recipe, way of life to pass the wall of the invisible and find the siens.
Then signs emerged.
The first time this was the very strong felt of his presence on the passenger side as I was driving.
One more time, a warm réveil in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, laid on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father who helps me with my actions over the years.
Our mother left us after her épuisant fight against cancer.
That's part of what I thought the day I found his body empty, criss-covered on that hospital bed with frowned drapes.
As well as his funeral, his funeral was a glacial tribute focussed around the maigre lueur of the chandelles that surrounded his coffin.
I would think she was gone.
Little to no, by little dieting or late-night, a little timid, a little effacing, she soon returned to my mind, operating over and over as she resumed her place in the landscape of my thinking that was believed to be in mourning.
And so, she revealed herself while revealing my own aspects that I hadn't yet seen, mastered by my relationship with her.
I have now learned and realized that I had hardly lost my mother's person but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who played that person, throughout her stint in life.
In dying, this woman had perfect her life and freed the person I liked, and now I found her, full and full.
This détour of the way of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful one.
It's a privilege to know that the loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and outside" parting.
We always told me.
I never believed it at all.
I had difficult relationships with him until he became old, sick.
There I barely got to know him and I was able to love him.
One day he died.
For years, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I got it, when I got it wrong...
He spoke to me, constantly encourageted me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at the mime, I was lending to him my body.
But it was never unsettling.
I was able to have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted long enough then one day he went.
Eventually it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said that the deceased people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer but I constantly feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always look back: What would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week that's certain.
I often dream of the last moments I need to share with them before it's too late, only, there's always one thing that keeps me from accomplir that moment.
I often wake myself angoissed when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me over and fit into my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The night after my eating-in when I needed to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I was woke up, I would walk out of bed, my father would look at me on the floor and he smiled and hoped I would be waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had paid me to sleep in my sleep to signal that he shared with joy what happened to me.
And well, this was a little boy in my stomach.
I liked sharing that moment with him and I take to telling that common memory experienced after his death.
Just five years ago my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
That's to say the shock her disappearance caused in the young bachelier I was at the time.
I've despite all of it achieved my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, particularly in the moments when I am in trouble, or when I need important decisions.
Apprendre Arabic and looking at the Middle East, to the point of making a master in a major school, were not, with the recul, anodyne choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has taught me are always present, so much so that it happens to me to think about how she would want me to act at one point.
It is as if I am trying to be at the best of the generosity and the droppance of spirit of anyone who was a feral croyante.
Now, I feel her as a daily presence, a biennial soul, a salvaging spirit.
I see her eyes laid on me.
My mother died dix-neuf years ago now.
Morte after talking to me over the phone.
I went through all phases: confusion, anger, pain, crying that happens alone, any time, any time, in unexpected places, incongruous times.
Then, time eased the pain.
Have remained only the lack, that void without a response, that need for her, to give me, to reassure me at the creux of its douceur.
Indeed, she's there, silent presence, she's there and looks at me.
Every morning I see her worried eyes laid on me, I see the ceramic eyes alourdit her face, the ridules around her lips that cigarettes dig, the plis that mark the front on days of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning I distourne my eyes.
My wife and mother of my 3 children died of cancer at 43.
We feel in his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was her promise on her bed of pain, so we little more than relearned to smile, and prononcé her name is no longer tabou but comfort.
Well on, I talk to him in the creux of the night when absence does get too bad, it steps into my dreams when the morale is a bit reached.
We feel carried and protected in the difficult times, the passing of time makes us realize how much she was a head coach and we are trying to stay in the path she had set us.
If an being loved you very hard, absence cannot take you from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your domestic energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008, of amiante cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted in order to understand what he thought or what he enjoyed.
I couldn't attend his inhumation and three weeks after his death I was giving birth to a little boy.
While I have my sometimes different beliefs from the siennes, I always wonder if my activities are consistent with his view of things.
I first had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me it's impossible to go in a opposite direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he will think.
I don't know if I adopted his way of being or if I'm simply like him: Is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
He was a bit like an alter-ego, there wasn't to be talk between us.
So, he's there over there.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
Voila bientôt 30 years since my husband died aged 33.
I was 28 and our son 6.
The immense pain that then envaed me has far atténuated but he is still close to me.
Very often he "débarque" into my dreams in such a detailed, so alive way that at the réveil I am even more sad to find that this was only a dream.
The other night he asked me if I would go well, I told him no, he would answer "I will descend" but in such a real voice that I woke up in sursaut, anxious and lit the lamp on my lap watching everywhere, convinced that he would come.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I look back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In all the plays I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we have been happy and or her spirit lives with me.
I'm 58, I've always experienced alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I look forward to saying I am sociable with a job at responsibility, I laugh and sing, I walk, I'm grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
From beef in products to beef
More meat was found in boxes of beef products, sold by two small British retail chains, the agency responsible for food hygiene, the food safety agency said today.
routine tests revealed the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA at up to 1 to 5 percent.
"Since horse meat is not mentioned in the ingredients list, it should not have been present in the product," said the British agency.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in raw food erupted in Europe at the start of the year, following tests conducted in Ireland.
In European Commission tests, France has been the country hardest hit by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
Iraq: October was the deadliest month since 2008
Octobre was in Iraq the deadliest month since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants US help.
"We are not saying to the world to be at our side and to support us, we have the right to ask it to the world because we do," Al-Maliki said on Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what happens in Iraq is not resolved, that will expand, and what happens in Syria will expand too.
And what happens when a terror virus lives? it is spreading.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the US Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
At the back of the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They brandished banners accusing him, among other things, of being a killer and urging the US to refuse to provide him with help.
Paris Saint-Germain will host Lorient on Friday without their master asset, Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the French club announced in a statement.
PSG, the league leaders ahead of Monaco at the away goal, released the list of players selected for this 12e journée match, without the 26-year-old striker including.
The statement simply states that he is "injured," without préciser the nature of the injury.
He nonetheless suffered inflammation of his left knee during his return from injury on September 1.
Mick Jagger says he never drags Katy Perry when she was 18.
At an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a choriste on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had been dining with the rock veteran and explained, "He drags me when I was 18."
She said, "It was a long time ago, and he's been very nice."
In a statement Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he "strongly denies making advances to Katy Perry."
The representative said: "Maybe she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the chanteuses to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones' tour this year.
His new album, "Prism," landed at No. 1 on the charts this week.
Accrochage between Palestinians and Israelis at Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded Thursday, October 31, 2013 at a violent clash at the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The Gaza Strip's only power plant stopped operating Friday, Nov. 1 after an bout of fuel supplies, the Palestinian energy authority said.
A local commander of Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another senior member of the Hamas armed wing, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a char fire during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younès, in southern Gaza, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found themselves dead when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
To Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were leading a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Israeli attack on tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli char and a blind-headed bulldozer made an incursion a dozen yards inside the territory before returning later.
The clash lasted a half-hour, witnesses said.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and said Israeli soldiers had found themselves killed during the confrontation.
Hamas félicite Al-Qassam heroes who fell while defending the territory during an incursion by the sioniste occupant in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and wounded over the operation.
"Hamas insists Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," the spokesman threatened.
On its part, the Israeli military said the target of its operation was at the start a section of a wide tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered Oct. 7 and intended, the military said, for "terrorist activities."
Hamas claimed to use tunnels to fight Israel, saying the goal was to kidnap Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using that tunnel, said an Israeli military statement.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device targeting Tsahal forces (the Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Attaque Israeli in northern Syria
"This mission was impérative because of the risk of terrorist use of the tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," army spokesman Peter Lerner said by telephone.
By contrast, Israel struck an air force base in northwestern Syria, targeting a cargaison of missiles aimed at the Lebanese Shiite militant movement Hezbollah, the satellite news channel Al-Arabiya reported Thursday.
A U.S. official confirmed an Israeli "strike" but did not give details on the target.
"By the past, the targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he was quoted as saying.
Israeli government officials have however declined to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citant "exclusive sources" it did not name, the Saudi channel said "the bombing targeted a cargaison of sol-air missiles that was intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that fights rebels at the hands of Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian charity, the Syrian Rights Observatoire, had reported several explosions heard Wednesday at dawn in an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
That organization drawing on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Disney relies on shelves to launch animated series
US media and entertainment group Disney has decided to favor the computers at its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new series for children.
Sheriff first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie' s Wild West will be available as of November 24 on the watchdisneyjunior.com website or via its application for phones and computers.
Its global launch on Disney's channels is scheduled only in 2014, the statement from its Disney Junior division detailed.
The dessin animé, aimed at children ages 2 to 7, tells the adventures of the chateau Callie, a sheriffs from a western American town where she does régnate order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and computers is a second nature for children today," said Albert Cheng, vice president for digital products at Disney / ABC Television Group, according to the statement.
This type of experience comes as part of Disney's efforts to "extend the life span of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are becoming more important," he said.
A poll released in early May by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in mobile devices use by young children in the United States: 38 percent of children under 2 have already been using a laptop or phone, and 72 percent of under 8, up from respectivement 10 percent and 38 percent two years ago.
Friday, around 15 a.m.
The motard, Jonathan, 26, of Fléron, did not wear a helmet.
Despite the quick intervention of the emergency services, he died during that fatal collision.
US to go on Halloween colors
In the US, President Obama has not disavowed Halloween tradition.
With his wife on Tuesday night, he distributed friars to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the US east coast had been cancelled because of Hurricane Sandy's passage.
This year, fêtards have now been rattraping.
In New York, thousands of costumed people joined the parade held in the neighborhood of "Greenwich village."
Everybody is sur-excited, "recalled one of the participantes, Andrea.
Well, I was able to finally put on the costume I had planned last year.
We're laughing like crazy, "Rhonda added.
People are happy.
It's good fun, it's cool.
You really have to do that.
Halloween is a paedophile holiday celebrated on the eve of the Toussaint, mainly in the anglo-saxons.
Pitcairn to create world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, the New Zealand daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti said Thursday, echoing an information from Radio Australia.
That island, just east of the Gambian (French Polynésie) island, is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
That territory measures 47 km2, if you count three other small close islands.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the mutterings of the Bounty, an episode in the English Navy's history that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
Some dozen residents, in majority descendants of the Bounty mutts, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend at 95 per cent on the generosity of London.
The island's Council voted at the weekend in favour of creating a marine reserve around the tiny island, or 836,000 hectares which relate to its exclusive economic zone.
An deputy mayor of the island went to London asking Britain to approve that request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, says creating such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project is to be agreed by the English governor of Pitcairn, living in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow Britain to sanctum these 836,000 acres, at least to have the resources to provide surveillance, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to bask one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where military surveillance vessels place.
According to France, it already must carry out the highly costly air and sea surveillance of the five million hectares of the French Pacific ZEE, nearby to Pitcairn.
Greece: two dead in shooting near néo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured Friday night by shots fired by two people driving on a motorcycle that passed outside a local of the néonazi party Aube dorée in the western suburb of Athens, officials said.
The police were not in a position to give details about the victims' identity and their possible political appartenance.
Some Greek media reported that members of the doré Aube had argued that the victims were guards from their local.
The injured person was promptly hospitalized, the same source said.
Police from the antiterroriste service were dispatched to central street avenue in Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and sealed off the neighborhood.
The incident comes weeks after the indictment of six lawmakers from euro dorée, including the party's leader and founder, for membership in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against that party launched after the death of an antifascist musician by one of its members.
Parents parents of Georgia teenager, who died in unexpected circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found in a tapis of track driven through the gym at his high school, think their son was murdered, the family attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found Jan. 11 stuck in a tapis backed up behind the gym seats at his high school.
Investigators in the comté of Lowndes concluded Johnson had died in unexpected circumstances, but the girl's family disputes those findings.
"They're absolutely sure their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, said on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as is indicated in the shsheriff's findings.
"They think this defies any logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.
They are convinced these findings were delivered in the sole purpose of covering up the or the people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a carol and we handed him in a mortuary bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained without answers.
What is the cause of death?
His death was the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke during a news conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll give back to the facts, where they lead.
My aim is to discover the truth.
"I consider there to be a sufficient basis" to open an official inquiry, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated Johnson had died of "positional asphyxie."
Still, a second autopsy has identified another cause of death, Moore said.
"Many questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore said that if he puts to rest evidence of any nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative from the state sheriffs office in Lowndes was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him Thursday.
A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to turn over all CCTV tapes investigators had examined.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video images contained clues about the circumstances of his death.
Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his trace, was in fact buried in a common grave at a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the Mémorial Army's Mémorial of the Red Army's President, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a joint grave at Berlin-Mitte Jewish cemetery," he assured the high-tirage daily by drawing on archives documents.
That revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would answer one of the great énigmes of Après-Guerre.
German German secret services, the BND, insisted as much as the summer of 1949, Müller was living in Karlovy Vary, then in Tchécoslovaquie, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The intelligence agencies were completely wrong.
"From August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," Mr. Tuchel said.
He wore "a general uniform."
"In the domestic side pocket were reportedly his états of service with a photo," he added.
Bild also publishes a document from the district council in Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the neighborhood's Jewish cemetery.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutalized Nazi sadians be buried in a Jewish cemetery is an énormité of bad taste.
"We grossièrement foule off the memory of the victims," he was quoted as saying in the paper.
Heinrich Müller is among the important Third Reich figures who were never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and reportedly under his orders Adolf Eichmann, a senior "logistics" official of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to prêté serment
Mohamed Morsi paid investiture serment, but it is unlikely his victory day will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he paid the investiture serment for president, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from office 16 months earlier.
In his investiture before the constitutional High Court, Mr Morsi also became Egypt's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the ouster of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He paid serment before the 18 judges in black court dress whose building located in the middle of the Nil was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We are aspirational in better lendemains, a new Egypt and a second republic," President Morsi said at the televised ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fondamentalist group regarded for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal and durement réprimed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were keeping the building open when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to acclamate the new president and, différence from the presidential faste of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow the passage of his convoy through the heavily crowded streets linking downtown with the southern suburbs.
Considered as the "uncharismatic" leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown significantly since his victory and Friday speech at which he tried to cast himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to end the work begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, told the judges sitting in the room ornée with boiling boileries where he paid serment.
Later, Mr. Morsi flew to Cairo University where he delivered his investiture speech.
He was officially greeted by a military fanfare that played the national anthem as he got over the phone.
marmaréchal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
On his arrival, he was greeted with the chant "The people and the army, hand in hand"... repeated by thousands of people gathered in the university's grand arena.
Fondée in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of militant student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath Friday on the Place Mubarak, from where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to retrieve présidentiable powers that the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, dispossesses him.
But by agreeing to formally prêté serment before the court, rather than before parliament as is of usage, he stands against the will of the military by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on the Place lot was accompanied by dramatic populism moves.
avionneurs are querelling over the size of seats as big orders are up.
The dispute is growing between the major aéronautique manufacturers over the size of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, opening the way for a bitter confrontation during the Dubai aéronautique show which takes place next month.
The dispute centers on the size of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy class passengers - which are not always the most courted by airlines, but whose space allocated is critical to increasing efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aerospace industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (38.72 inches) in economic classes, but its major US rival Boeing declared that it should be up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as avionneurs look to sell even bigger versions of their long-haul biplane, possibly hoping for a record order during the event that runs from Nov. 17 to Nov. 21.
The way seats will be arranged at the front of the plane - in particular, will there be 9 or 10 front seats - is critical to the economic return of the "mini-jumbo" segment.
Boeing declares that its "777X" reaménagé will accommodate 406 people in seats more than 17 inches wide, and will be configurable with 10 seats per rows.
Airbus says the rival version of its A350 will carry in the business class 350 people in 18-inch wide seats configurable in 9 + ranches.
aéronautique giants often trade hits on technical issues when doing advertising in the professional press.
Today Airbus is calling directly to the public ahead of the Dubai aéronautique show, when the 777X is expected to take the lead over competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were able to get to the bottom recently of what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people facing each other at the restaurant, titled "Will you accept that?"
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in tighter seats than in regional turbopropulseurs," John Leahy, Airbus' commercial director, said.
Because eating habits change, people are growing, but seats in planes haven't changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American's weight from 40 to 49 increased 10 percent, according to U.S. Department of Health data.
The average American's XXIe century weight is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus declares that its rival is hanging on to a seat concept that dates to the 1950s, when the circus-like "jet set" was tighter.
Airbus added that it has commissioned a study that indicates an extra pouce over the height of seats would improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures in terms of seat space and says it is up to the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also says the study shows that experience in cabine doesn't just depend on the height of seats.
"It is really about bringing flexibility to the airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their operations," Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing, said.
They don't want you to tell them what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers it is becoming more of a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies a race for aircraft orders for an estimated $700 Md at market price in the decades ahead, enough to make the balance of U.S. and European exports pencher.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat configuration is exactly what is fueling the battle among the very latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a per seat return in their latest long-haul biplane models 20 percent higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on comparison between the 777X configurable with 10 seats per rows and an earlier 777 model configurable in 9 rangées.
The gain in unannounced costs is low compared to the configurable aircraft with 10 seats per rows currently in service.
"Boeing is doing that to be able to cashed out more seats and make its planes more competitive compared to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Confort Passager director at European avionneur Airbus.
On another side, analysts say the configurable cabins with 10 seats per rows in existing 777 suggest many passengers are voting in favor of a dense configuration, which can go back to less expensive fares.
"An 18-inch seat largeur would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from the commercial perspective, Airbus' proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777," said cabinetry expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor in chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines must choose.
The sellers of planes that make the world's most popular carry even with them a mètre to check out rival configurations.
While venting to offer comfortable aircraft, all automakers are also offering planes with high-densité configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configurable with 10 seats per rows but says it hasn't yet sold it.
Up far, Airbus highlighted the need for greater personnalisation of cabins by offering wider side seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the one other major manufacturer of modern aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that its appeal to the aerospace industry in order to set up a size standard for seats will succeed, but it could make the 777X sales wave surge.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel target-friendly is capable of remarkable creative direction and minutieuse costume mal, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Looking running through the French Revolution of 1760, it tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a couvent by her family.
When she rebel, she does deal with the no-borne cruauté of a deliberately sadied Mother and becomes an object of érotique fascination with another.
The film never verse in lubricity or sensationalism, and that's right.
The consciencieux solennity of the narration could also become a pénitence for the audience.
Social musical, that bête of stage
Classiques, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the chantability and dancing productions take their toll.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: the American musical is emerging as a genre to be believed.
Long, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart's rock opera, most attempts would slip into ridicule.
And success successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables carried the auréole of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Châtelet and Stage Entertainment at Mogador changed the donne.
Today, these two scenes maniacal the titles like hit tubes.
The first returns on Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announced for the following year the worldwide creation of "An American in Paris."
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" could well be one of the season's hits.
On other scenes, musical shows like "1789," "the amers of Bastille" and small musical comedies like "Disco" or "Life and Times" get to the diapers of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires of musical comedies" and a conférencier at the National Theatre, is reviewing the reasons for such success so durement conquis.
How do French musical comédies operate?
The supply has been unmultiplied.
There are first "musical" shows that operate over producers....
Some use great images projections and a true story as in 1789, the Amants of the Bastille.
Many others make a quinze year leap forward under the impression that you can serve up just about anything when you have Matt Pokora in the lead.
After, we've got the musical comedies with the somptueux productions at the Châtelet that bring us back to Broadway's golden age and experience the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment populates British variety of variété songs by adapting them into French.
UK producers are trying a breakthrough.
But projects in the future like "Rent," "The Baiser of the arrow" or "The Eveil of spring" have struggled to be funded.
Have we enough of artists capable as on Broadway of singing, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn from projects to projects.
In the U.S., the birthplace of musical comedy, it's very different.
Kids are trained to these jobs in many schools.
jobs are common among regional théâtre, tournées, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The vibe of talent is as substantial as the number of jobs to be filled.
Why do tournées in the province have so much success?
At the exception of opera, the province remains the parent pauvre of culture in France.
Few of the play parts go on tour and it's often boulevard theater aimed at adults and not young adults.
The shows fill that lack.
It are those same young people who like téléréalité and what it produces as éphémères stars...
Proposer beautiful young (often talented) men as the lead singer of a musical is the assurance of an enthusiasm from these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of those shows are savaged by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a province Zénith.
The mayonnaise rose in Paris and dégustaged by provincial authorities.
The show is designed to enter all the major venues in France under the same name as in Paris.
Tokyo finit down 0.88 percent, says official
Tokyo Tokyo stock market ended lower Friday in spite of good Chinese manufacturing data.
The stock pâti from the dollar's decline against the yen, prejudiciable to export stocks and the warning on its full-year profit issued by Sony Thursday.
Japan's Nikkei average lost 125.37 points (0.88 percent) to 14 201,57 and the Topix fell 13.23 points (0.94 percent) to 1 182.03.
Sony fell more than 11 percent to $1 668 yen.
Ben Greenman: Dixième New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You might say New York City is the place where stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of the master of the show at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, was beginning to tell jokes directly to the audience, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation continued over the years, until it was repris most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and supervisé by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows being held in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of the top names emerged at Carolina.and had great success, until they became too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival in an effort to be able to continue working with them.
The event this year will include the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes," a comedy and music evening on behalf of the former combattants, held at Madison Square Garden, at which, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has taken hold, along with the comedy world.
Many of the actors participating in this year's festival went through nontraditional circuits, by example showing shows on small cable channels, like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his name on the front line in a sitcom on a câbles-only channel ("The League" on the joyously laser-ish fantasy of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch-show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate appeared on the "Saturday Night Live" show and was part of the casting of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is actually more known for her virgin "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with a unique voice (the surréaliste pessimiste Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate for racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pals from the décentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's main attraction factors this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talking with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an officious comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show that was called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."
The call takes place at the City Hall, in central Manhattan.
"The city is permanently in the comique DNA DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he was climbing a rug between two buildings and thinking, Eh well, if I lose all my money, maybe I would come to live here.
Découverte of drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico having its own railway track
One of the most sophisticated tunnels serving for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, having its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rails, has been discovered.
U.S. officials described the 4-foot by 3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagating over a length equivalent to nearly six feet of football fields, connects entrepôts near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, the United Arab Emirates.
The area regurgitated indéfiniment, which helps to easily conceal trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs went unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 pounds of cocaine after the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.
Three men who, authorities said, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life in prison if convicted.
In Nogales, Ariz., traffickers operate vast souterrains drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana crop in central Mexico in October, thus posing a challenge to drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, officials found a 1,700 yards cut off with feral tracks that went from the kitchen of a Tijuana house and went back to two entrepôts in San Diego.
Syria destroyed chemical weapons production capacity, the monitoring body declares
Syria destroyed the equipment critical to the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with toxic gases, the International weapons monitoring body said Thursday, as fierce clashes broke out in the country's north, just outside one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of civil war in the country nearly 3 1 / 2 years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the dessus of chemical weapons (OIAC) came with a day's notice on the deadline.
Nov. November set by the organization based in The Hague ordains Damascus to destroy or "make inutilisable" all chemical weapons production units and machines designed to combine toxic gases and fill munitions.
The achèvement of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitious timetable aimed at destroying Damascus's chemical weapons by mi-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
We think the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical weapons and weapons, including mallite gas and the neurotoxic sarin gas.
The announcement was made as fighting broke out Thursday in the town of Safira which, experts said, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Syrian Human Rights Observatoire based in Britain reported.
The group, which follows the progress of the human toll through a network of activists based in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, one estimate was that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, one estimate says 29,954 members of President Bachar al-Assad's armed forces have found their way, including 18,678 were fighters from pro-government forces and 187 from Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, one estimate also says 2,202 were déserters and some 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreign.
On July 25, the U.N. estimated 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It hasn't updated that figure since then.
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaida's network, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatoire said Thursday there were losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting highlighted the importance of the dangers facing inspectors with chemical weapons as they are due to complete their mission, which involves rid Syria of its toxic arsenal over a civil war that persist, in tight délais.
A statement by OIAC, which works in close collaboration with the U.N., indicated that its team was "now satisfied with having controlled - and seen destroyed - all the critical production and machines intended for mélange and remplissage."
It said "no other inspection activity was planned for the time being."
Earlier in the week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the vérification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They couldn't visit the remaining two sites because of concerns regarding their safety, inspectors said.
Thursday, OIAC said the two sites were, Syria said, "abandoned and... that elements of the chemical weapons program they contenaient had been moved to other declared sites, which have been inspected."
It was difficult to know at first whether Safira's unit was one of two sites OIAC inspectors couldn't visit.
Syria submitted a plan for total destruction of its chemical weapons that was approved the following month by the OIAC's Executive Committee.
"I applaud the moral strength and courage that you have all made in the course of the most difficult mission ever conducted by this organization," the organization's chief executive Ahmet Uzumcu said in a comment posted by OIAC.
Now in its third year, the civil war primarily pitted Sunni Muslim rebels against the government of al-Assad and its security forces, which are backed by members of the alt-right sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
Of another part, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatoire said there had been a heavy explosion Wednesday in an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the blast remains unknown, he said.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made about Jonathan Lord, during a Royal Commission hearing.
Two YMCA employees of New South Wales have been charged with sexual assault against children following allegations made about Caringbah éducator Jonathan Lord, in 2011 during a royal Commission hearing into child abuse.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said that it "had never had to deal with a sexual assault problem on children within its organization."
Chief executive Phillip Hare has been questioned over two matters: A YMCA employee was charged with offences relating to enfantine pornography and a YMCA physical education instructor at Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, an avocat-setting adviser to the Commission, that he had had knowledge of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inexact, noting, "external YMCA checks were conducted and indicated that the safety of children was an absolute priority for the organisation."
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst appréciations on four schools in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August of this year.
Mr Hare, who began working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to check that employees knew they were required to report any breach of children's safety policy.
Earlier in the year Lord was convicted of sexual assault on douze boys during the two years he worked at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of 6 years in prison.
But Mr Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures to the safety of children.
Members members testified that they had observed some of the violations, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, made them sit on his knees, told them he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was encadrée by Lord and had sought training in child protection because she worried about his behaviour, said she found the senior children's services at YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who was encadering Lord "very intimidatory and difficult to approach most of the time."
The chief executive said he rejected staff's accounts that they were reluctant about reporting these quement to their supérieur hiérarchique.
On top of that, he said the friendly relationships they had with Lord have brouillé their judgment, which makes them not reported his activities.
Mr Hare said that he had expressed his point to the South Wales YMCA Council saying that, for the organisation, the lesson learned from "the Jonathan Lord incident" was not to involve "signalement" by staff, and the board was of agreement with it.
Mr. Hare said the decision to make staff sign off on confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were discussed, was made by YMCA chief executive for children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said that decision was intended to prevent any contamination of evidence but that it was an "excess of zèle" and that it had been misplaced.
The South Wales YMCA was not a safe organisation for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed, to be known as between 2009 and 2011, the expert on sexual violence on children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the Commission.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruiting, testing, initiation, training and staff supervision.
The hearing was ajournées until Dec. 20.
A ceremony in memory of crewrights défunts
Père Père Lachaise crematorium is holding, at 11: 00 am, a secular ceremony, in memory of all cremation in his school, over the next year.
Anne Hidalgo, a Labour candidate for mayor of Paris is due to attend, and will then explain, in a press conference, her proposals in funeral planning.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funeral, more Americans are choosing cremation, rather than inhumation: 53 percent, according to an Ipsos study conducted Sept. 6 and 7 of 1009 people, instead of 47 percent.
For a close friend's funeral, it's the opposite: Americans prefer inhumation (53 percent to 47 percent).
If they have the malheur of losing a child, they are only 15 percent to choose cremation.
In his book La Mort in cendres, Damien Le Guay, a philosophe and vice chairman of the National Committee on funéraire ethics, stresses the "violence" that cremation provides, for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "violence done to the loved one," which is going to be "reduced to a tas of ashes" in very little time, and not after a process of disablement, which would "accompany the phases of grief."
There is also "symbolic violence," which stands for the "Treating of singularity and the distinctively distinct signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is that accepted without peine in some northerners and Catholics, still misunderstood in the UK?
"Because cremation is a new fact," replied Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Royal Society of thanatology and author of the book Apprivoising Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Roman Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to apprivoise it.
Apprivoising cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, the director general of the Ville of Paris's notary Services, to plan for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as the one he would have to do with an inhumation.
Ipsos's annual survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of the French want one, for their loved ones, whether it be religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people choosing a cremation wish to attend a ceremony.
66 percent of athées or noncroyants also want it.
The crematoriums have grown up to this evolution of society.
"For a few years they have been trying to avoid the violence of an wait, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the transfer of ashes," observed Mr. Michaud-Nérard.
70 percent of the schools now offer master ceremonies, who procèdent, in front of the body, to the following ritual: accueillir the assembly, naming the deceased, connecting it to others, discussing it, giving meaning to his death, organizing adieu.
That has been the case at Père Lachaise crematorium, since 1998.
The master witnesses are often people who have reconverted.
There are also former Roman Catholic priests.
It is in this capacity that the Père Lachaise crematorium has, since 2010, the Day of The Toussaint, several memory ceremonies, secular and non-religious, which it invites families of the people who have been cremated in the past year.
For the second consecutive year, one of those ceremonies is retransmis enmasse, to the attention of those who might not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
Hagel accuses 9 U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, "all military spouses have a right to a State Department identity card and benefits that come with it," the minister pointed out in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League's Anti-fur famation League.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to conjoints of same sex in the National Guard facilities" operating on their territory, he denounced, accusing those states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social services or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The secretary of defense said he has ordered the National Guard chief, Maj. Gen. Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The fronde by the nine states began by Texas which refuses to put in place those benefits on the text-based National Guard implantations, because of a dispute between the text-based law and the federal gay marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior Defense Department official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by gay marriage to about 5600 active people, 17 million including the National Guard, reserve and retirees.
Oil prices continue to drop and move closer to $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to drop Friday as concerns regarding the importance of supplies offset a report showing that China's nation's gourmand manufacturing sector is set to strengthen.
The price of benchmark U.S. crude for December delivery dropped 14 cents to $95.24 a barrel in late morning trading in Europe during electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents Thursday, leaving it with a 5.3 percent drop for the month of October.
The abondante supply of crude oil has weighed on the price over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.2 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector arrived Friday, which show activity growth, suggest higher demand.
This suggests China's economic recovery may continue to raffle up after growth rebounded to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, after a drop that you hadn't seen in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a reference for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who is presenting at Danse Danse her two new group chorégraphies: the first inspired by Henri Michaux's encores and poems, the second insuffled by Satie's so-called piano Gymnopédies.
A evening that helps you see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a back wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the huge space that is the New York Theater, he moves, out of profile, late like a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple trait, takes its shape.
And that shape will be that of the play: an engraver of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only their hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next graphie appears, play it, resent in passing.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is in between solos, a group at a time (a mass that does solo), a large 12-piece solos where each exécuts his sign.
You think of "Gloire of the morning," when, as a solo, Chouinard was performing a series of chorégraphic tasks written on cartels, laid out online at the front.
That's the same principle, a giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussions and electric guitares.
The energy is high, the pace always fast.
There will be cassure when Carol Prieur refuge under the dance floor, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriété or restraint, part of Michaux's poem, monocorde and monotone in the crib, and continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to resume.
This sonore and énergique, long décharge, if that can be, ends up assaying and engroaching.
As also does the régularité of the visual rhythm.
There are some fine flashbacks - creating images has always been a strength at Chouinard - like those hair that is eking or those black fabric that stretch the lines.
But the chorégraphic approach lacks composition.
You have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to the heart of Michaux's work, has emerged, with her tics.
Résultat: The bodies seem to be flat ahead of the drawings.
Michaux's encents, like Gestalt forms, open a wider and giboßer imagination than dance, more poetic.
Only the end, in negative light, with its dancers hounded by stroboscoping light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches to magic.
The audience loved it, the accueil was warm.
Gymnopédies, after the entry-level performance, is richer.
The scene is in part draped in gray, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabric, like furniture in a disused house.
At piano, dancers were relaying to play the partitions.
Their malady in music, tously, give real fragilité.
On stage, the couples pass, in romantic duos, very sensual, even érotically.
Work group, small solo solos, ensembles moving, choirs, writing is less binary.
Other bouffons appear, as familiar as Chouinard, sporting red nose, in highly polarised hommes-woman parades.
The amours are carnassiers, fudge or players.
The gestuelle, laughs and small cries bends the archaic, grâce and ridiculous of bodies in coït, êtres that fit.
But the play takes its real envol after the salut.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the exploratory worlds superpose, the dancers crank, descend among the spectators, glom, fudge, court-circuit, play codes of applause, étirer sauce in a savage désordre that remains sensual.
joie and folie transpired, and it's Chouinard's art, there, to contamine the audience.
Important fire in shop
A fire badly damaged a shop in the arrondissement of LaSalle, New York, in the early hours of Thursday.
Firefighters were called about 1am on Friday because of a fire which had broken out at the basement of an Indian cooking restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The couple of firefighters who were dispatched to the scene spent nearly an hour tackling the blaze.
The fire "caused extensive damage to the structure of the building," Fire Department chief Richard Bordeaux said.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly 20 homes, located on the first and second floors of that row of commercial space, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested, because residents of one of the apartments may have to be housed temporarily, the SIM said.
Report: Obama campaign seen as letting Biden down for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers to President Barack Obama have considered, in the most recent fashion, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, the New York Times said.
This revelation is the most striking event that appears in Mark Halperin's highly anticipated 2012 book, "Double Down: Game Change: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published Thursday night and told reporters that the president's close aides had conducted "apologue-level work in groups and polls late next year" to see if Biden's exit could help Obama in his re-election as his hopes grew.
To Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of top campaign and White House officials, including former White House Secretary of State Bill Daley, aimed at gauge what effect the vice president's replacement with former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the vote.
The possibility of a swap is a secret that has been fiercely kept within the Chicago campaign headquarters and inside the White House.
Only a half-dozen close aides to the president - notably Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that change was at hand.
"Double Down" indicates Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties," before finally deciding against change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley told the paper.
Rappen that at that point, the president wasn't in shape, and so you were saying, "monsters, what can we do? '"
While Daley described the exam as "concert-driven," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to discover whether the change would be beneficial in the vote.
"campaigns don't spend a lot of money on polls and discussion groups at least until they are seriously considering taking action," Martin said on AC360.
However, we don't know if Obama was over the top that his team was reviewing the replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss from then was aware of the potential remaniement.
Although Daley said he did not think the president "was aware" of the potential change, the former secretary of state admitted it was "possible" Obama had known.
Martin said "Double Down" did not answer in a final way to the question of whether political polls had arrived on Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama did not know Biden's removal from the presidential list was being considered.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
David Bowie: four inédits records on écoute
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
As of The Next Day, published in January, he has concocté a luxury reissue scheduled for Nov. 4, with several inédits.
Four have already emerged on the internet.
News announcement of the release of a new David Bowie album had everyone panicking.
On day of his 66e birthday, Jan. 8, 2013, he had declared that a new album would release in March.
After 10 years of silence (the last record, Reality, dates to 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved we could still rely on him to light up the pop scene.
A festin for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than a round in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has so far planned to réédite that album on November 4.
For the occasion, he has concocté a real festin for his fans.
This reissue, called The Next Day Extra, will run under three tracks: the original album, unprecedented studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously announced clips.
The Next Day Extra will contiendra over 10 additional tracks from the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie first made the presentations of this fine coffret in a video.
He introduction to both each of the records, but also accessories provided with: photos and exclusive pochettes, a carnet to share your own impressions, a livret with the words...
And, especially, he gives a taste of his new Atomica title, typically in the veine of The Next Day, with very much in the way of guitares and savage rock electricity.
'New inédits' already on écoute
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the toile.
The Informer is double-face: a inquiétante intro before a lumineuse cavalcade that gradually slows down to leave room for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With that enchanting title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he has no feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again makes reference to his étrangeté: Would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, envoûting, give you envie to leave Earth.
Bowie is in any case trying to play the camel with these titles: round the informative, man on a rocket, potential marvel...
He dissimule and reveals at once, plays to adopt different celebrities, as he has done all along, particularly with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
None of which means he now has a face mask in the photograph of the campaign The Invitation to Voyage, by Louis Vuitton, whose Louis Vuitton brand, which he plays as the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast as early as November 10.
bird bird hélitched from platform in North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, héliced after being found exhausted on a oil platform in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
We got the water râler up a helicopter in front of Aberdeen last month before it was turned back on by the écossaise SPCA to its Alloa rescue centre.
The centre's director, Colin Seddon, said: "This water râle was probably a hivernant migratory that came from northern Europe and found itself caught over high winds in the North Sea."
It appears the exhausted bird may have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He said: "He was unable to fly again, we have now been contacted to provide our help."
The water râler was in good condition when it was released.
Cogeco Câble may soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Câble subscribers may well have access to applications like Facebook, Apple and ultimement Netflix's video service via their television in a future that doesn't seem so distant.
Cogeco's parent company said Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of that platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to put in more convivially friendly interfaces as well as more options," said Cogeco President and Chief Executive Louis Audet in an interview.
Cogeco Câble is ainsi emboîting the ante to its rivals, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's parent company does not yet have a specific date in terms of that new platform.
"It's important to adapt and change or resist change and fail," Mr. Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not have currently.
Communications giant Rogers has previously said it may offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been named, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in talks with some major câblodistributeurs so its service is available via their broadcast platforms.
The p.-d.g. of Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also praised the announcement made by the government in its Trône speech on Oct. 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the option to pay for the services on the go.
"It's been at least two and a half years since we say the idea of forcing consumers to buy significant channels of channels, it doesn't work," Mr. Audet said.
He is also hoping consultations carried out by the Federal Communications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these talks some kind of new reference ground to define our new American cultural policy in terms of television," the Cogeco p.-p.m.
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public for the past week and they are expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the other hand, Cogeco said it reported net income of $43.6 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 cents per share.
It is a decline compared to net income of $44.9 million, or 83 cents per share, in the same period last year.
The company based in New York explains this decline by amortisation costs associated with further acquisitions.
Cogeco in 2012 acquired the Atlantic Broadband network, based in the United States, for $1.36 billion.
It was the company's first major acquisition after one that had failed in Portugal.
In December, the New York-based company also bought Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for the sum of $526 million.
According to Cogeco's revenues, they had 41.5 percent growth in the fourth quarter to reach $504.7 million.
They are $1.7 billion for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
Net income at its main subsidiary, Cogeco Câble, was $43.9 million, or 90 cents per share, down from $45,713 million, or 93 cents per share, in the same period last year.
Cogeco Câble's revenues also rose 45 percent to reach $470.2 million.
The company lost 15 237 customers in the fourth quarter.
Still, for the 2013 fiscal year, Cogeco Câble's number of customers is up 5546.
Mr. Audet does not worry about the number of customers flailing out.
For me, this is the indication of a change in trend, "he observed.
It varies from one quarter to the next with very fierce competition.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom declares Bulgaria gazoduc inaugures new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gazoduc in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's biggest energy projects, Gazprom's director said.
"A historic event took place today: construction began in the bulgare part of the South Stream gazoduc, the largest single project in Europe," Alexei Miller, Gazprom's chief executive, said in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to help diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contrasting dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart from Ukraine, the country through which the largest share of Russian gas goes to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director added.
Miller said the direct jonction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "for ever."
bulbulky consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put on line in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to start in other countries located in aval by the end of the year.
The gazoduc was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
gunmen fire on hotel near Cairo pyramids
Armed encroaching gunmen opened fire on Friday on a hotel close to the pyramids in Cairo in Egypt without causing any casualties, a consequence of an apparent dispute with fired workers.
The attackers took cover, said Interior Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Abdel Latif.
That attack comes as Egypt has practically received no tourists since the military destituted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi early this month and repressed into the streets protests by his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on math, orthographe and grammar.
As part of English literature classes, students will have to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a XIXth century novel, a romantic poem and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to our days.
The exam will also feature "new" legislation to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining literature and English language will be scrapped.
As of 2015, pupils will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Department of Education is due to publish its new English and maths programmes tomorrow - the first matières to undergo radical review.
He will be procèdent to changes in other fundamental subjects next year.
By contrast, Ofqual, the exam regulator, will unveil a remaniement of the exam structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking speaking over the summer, Michael Gove, the education secretary, said there was a "wide consensus as to the need to reform our exam system to restore public confidence," stressing that the GCSE would be "more stimulatory, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Research show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian-owned schools offer in average 143 hours a year, and Singapore students do about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal requirement to spend more of the time away from maths, sources close to the coalition government said that the in-depth maths oulder - as well as the greater importance given to the subjects appearing in international rankings - would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of classes.
The program will put more emphasis on "problems of the real world," including financial mathématiques.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring together businesses and define what wealth and jobs creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the most comprehensive and comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov questioned more than 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of all size of companies, sectors and regions of Britain.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We discovered that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export in outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU states stagnate.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than enlist in the long and arduous process of reform of European institutional arcanes.
When asked their views on specific policy issues - ranging from monopoles' regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders think that control of those key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has caused general discontent, with companies saying the cost of the Brussels settlement is disproportionnée compared with the benefits there are to making up the European trading zone - 40 percent of the big companies, traditionally the most pro-European, are even of agreement.
Finally, and what is more telling still, our survey of business leaders found that a significant majority wanted Britain to continue initiatives in favour of a change in the treaty and development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major companies and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world is pushing for "meaningful change" that restore power to Britain.
The stakes are high - achieving to change the treaty and better represent Britain's interests would allow a basculer of 16 per cent of votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt himself a bit: this survey shows British companies support this plan aimed at renégocier the terms of Britain's EU membership.
It also shows that companies hope the renégociation will provide a meaningful change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of Britain.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, although the euro zone is moving on the path of closer economic and tax union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means putting again the emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
Beijing sets up Islamic turkmène movement
"The support in the coulisses for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of Turkestan oriental based in Central and Western Asia," the head of the Chinese security organs told a Hong Kong television station, according to a video put out Thursday night on a Web site.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee (PCC), was speaking in Tachkent during an official visit to Ouzbékistan.
It is the first time a Chinese official names a particular organization after Monday's attack.
To Chinese police, three Ouïghours from a single family in the region's majority Muslim region of Xinjiang, frontalière of several Central Asian countries, précipited their car packed with gasoline bidons against the entrance to the Red Sea in Beijing, in an attack that left two people dead and 40 wounded.
The car driver, his wife and mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which declared itself fighting for independence of Turkestan oriental, a former name for Chinese Xinjiang, was listed by the U.N. in 2002 among organizations affiliated with al-Qaida.
That movement is often named by Chinese authorities as being responsible for the sporadic troubles in Xinjiang, but its actual influence is put into question by several experts.

Ruby, a cocky épagneul, had escaped after a road accident without serious damage.
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the career.
Firefighters fell in rappel the length of the falaise to retrieve the dog and rescue it from some death.
A chiot got the chance to escape the worst after firefighters were called to pick him up in due course as it was perched about 15 feet above ground on the unstable sailbed of a falcon.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker, escaped after a road accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his little friend Becky Hall, 20, drove to Flappit's career at Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately sought out their lost dog and issued a appeal on social networking sites after she disappeared in the career following a no contest.
updated 1430 Wednesday, a person with a aiguilles sight walking her dog spotted Ruby on a corniche in the park, stuck about 15 feet above ground zero.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the scene and descended in a bid to rescue Ruby by using a civilist for animals to carry her up the top of the falaise.
Emergency rescue specialist Andy Clayton said: "She was in a precarious position."
It was in the middle of the falaise, about 15 feet from the summit and 15 feet from the ground.
It absolutely did not move during the rescue - it was frozen.
But she's doing fine now.
She ate biscuits after that.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Senior rescue specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a lot of chance of getting away indemne."
She could have been severely injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a test; her general condition was satisfactory, set aside from épuisment and déshydratation.
Mlle Hall, of Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified by watching the rescue."
I initially didn't think she was there là-haut.
It was surprising to have him again in his arms.
The vet said that if she had been too exhausted and she had escaped, she would likely have fallen.
The were épatating.
What they did was really brave.
We're so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely tremendous.
Mr Alderson, of Keighley, said: "We got to think she would fall but she didn't move."
The firefighters were super.
I can't believe she was là-haut.
Ukraine moves closer to bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's on Friday lowered Ukraine's solvabilité rating, putting on question the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to deal with its financial obligations.
The country's public debt securities goes to "B-," falling into the category of spéculatifs investments.
It is subject to a negative outlook, with S & P seeing at least one chance of three that it will be cut back by a year.
"It is becoming less likely that the government's strategy will allow it to guarantee enough foreign currency to make up its high external funding needs," said the US agency.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell 26 percent between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complique the remboursement of mortgages taken abroad.
Those reserves, which officials have used heavily to support the local currency, the hryvnia, are collapsing, with the agency increasingly finding it likely a deferral, which would boost its external debt.
Kiev has to by far pay cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an $882 million bill.
That announcement provides bad news for Ukraine's ruling coalition in a time of sharp tensions with its Russian neighbor, angry over Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU late Thursday.
It was made public on the eve of the release of official statistics showing the country's economy had suffered between July and September its fifth straight quarter of contraction.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S & P estimates it at 33.5 percent of GDP, up from less than 10 percent before the 2008-2009 downturn.
The country, in a budget deficit, has for months sought help from the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 had granted it a $15.3 billion credit and has for now disbursed only 3.4 billion dollars.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche as long as the country has not passed unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including increasing gas prices to the public.
At a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF this week found that "the significant need for external funding" posed "vulnerability," while raising "signs of economic improvement."
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, of the Center for Policy Etudes, "you can't expect any improvement at all."
"There is little hope that imperfect reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," with presidential elections due in 2015, relève the expert, speaking to AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international outlook.
S & P in turn relève the "uncertainty" associated with the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditionne to the release of Ms. Yushchenko's constituent PRNewswire-FirstCall.
"Sending the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative long-term consequences associated with Russia's reaction," said S & P, which fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, warned that in the event of creating a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should step up its border controls for imported goods.
Singapore lenders draw on middle classes forced to serrer down
At a lender on gage from Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga drops a bracelet, bague and pair of gold ear bougs to pay for her daughters' tuition.
"My husband and I are about to buy a house so all my money went inside," Ms. Amirthalinga declared.
Although she makes $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income does not matter, she says.
In fact, demand is such in some parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is increasing - that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, this week became the third real estate loan company to be introduced to Singapore's bourse.
Putting up jewelry is not only a quick way to get money - $1,300 from Singapore in Ms. Amirthalinga's case - but it's almost as good as unguaranteed bank loans.
In general, Singapore's mortgage lenders prepay an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bail bailleur with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, lenders on gage have the advantage of not seeking a solvabilité vérification or salary evidence, and can débloquer loans more quickly than banks.
By conséquent, millions of people around the region are turning to lenders on gage as families feel the pressure that the increasing cost of living and the overspend of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global credit crunch, and good credit fueled by too laxiste monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and average incomes turn to lenders on gage to bridge the difference as their economies experience a slowdown.
This week, the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency cited the growing consumer debt, resulting primarily from rising subprime loans, as a risk factor for the No. 1 Asian banks' No. 1 No. 1 lender.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest household debt / gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia comes in second with 80 percent of GDP, while that rate was 60 percent in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which emerged from little this week from a technical recession.
Thursday's data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The record is that with rising costs, people on the middle or low end [of the pay scale] are looking to complete their incomes as they can," stated Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a malaisien bank.
The prices of gold have over the past two years made people rushed to put in their personal effects to touch the value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items set aside in the city-owned loan boutiques are in gold.
People say, "The gold price is high, put in the gold chain of grand-mère and we'll return it next month."
In Thailand, the largest credit card shop operator, EasyMoney, reported a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its boutiques over the past few months.
The rise is such in the qna lending sector that ValueMax, operator of the shop in Bendemeer and 15 other boutiques like this in Singapore, expects to grow not just in neighboring Malaysia - where it already has four boutiques - but also in outside Asia, Yeah Lee Ching, its chief executive, declared.
The Company will fund them by using 60% of the $66 million Singapore raised this week in its initial public offering.
Whereas some lenders with reduced rates have faced criticism for the exorbitante interest rates they practice, Mlle Yeah says that the offering not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but in turn it does not directly increase debt.
"Customers hypothèid property they already own, and the fact of monezing their personal property does not increase household debt," she says.
The set of gage is better and better accepted socially as a way to get guaranteed short-term funding.
People who get to lenders on gage are not just those who have financial problems.
affluent people in Singapore also go to the ValueMax loan boutiques to set aside gold lingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers from all couches of society.
"It can be aisle-income people who have to borrow short-term for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that have cash needs to pass a tough time," Mlle Yeah added.
Sometimes they just have to spend money very quickly.
coccocky lawyer who informed drug dealer of police investigation has been imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime seigneur Neil Scarbrough
Attorney had fear his secret drug addiction would be revealed to the public
He was sentenced to a three-year prison sentence by Liverpool Crown Court.
A major defence lawyer, who had informed a drug dealer of a major police investigation because he had fear his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to crime seigneur Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his related drug dealing activities after he compromised due to his habit of drinking cocaine.
The lawyer, who was dubbed "Bash" and considered by criminals a "first class case," was arrested home in 2011 following police écoute operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in relation to the drug trade.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, in the process of dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, as he attended a Barreau dinner with fellow officers.
The investigations found Ditta was a "regular" user of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her purse and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two men for the benefit of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.
The four suspects were being monitored at the time by police as part of a major investigation into a trafficking of heroin and cocaine taking place in the Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were by the time police seized heroin and cocaine for a total of £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash over a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared his toxicity would be revealed to the public.
Today, at Liverpool Crown Court, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors law firm located in Blackburn, fell disbarred after being found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-month trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, pure at 60 percent, under the lawyer's trash bin in a black golf bat.
Shortly after the filing, Scarborough was regularly in phone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at Ewood Park, the ground venue of Blackburn Rovers' home ground.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug and they called nine times.
The court heard Ditta was a "regular" cocaine user after tests showed traces of this class A drug in his hair, on his purse and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but denied drinking cocaine. He said he had spoken to the alleged drug dealing offender because he was his client and made clear their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege."
Over his arrest, Ditta rammed his purse and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and one prepped on a hair sample.
During an interrogation, he said he owned an office at his home, as well as at his home and that it happened to have clients call him home for legal issues.
But the court heard accounts that he called major players in the drug trade, including some he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which detectives were on the run.
Sheriff Anne Whyte said: "If someone needs to know that it's not about breaking the law, it's right a pénal-law lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a pénaliste, and of being too involved with individual clients.
The relationship that we talk about is not simply a drug dealing, but a drug dealing dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will no doubt be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But that went far beyond the ordinary boundaries of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He entraved the police investigation as much as he could to enable him to pursue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not make up his profession, but déshonore him.
He has grown too close to some customers, in particular Scarborough, and he has let his independence compromettre.
Ditta denied any illegal agony and said: "If I were a corrompu lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, superintendor Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta went from a pénalement qualified lawyer to criminal himself as soon as he began to get drugs from criminal organisations."
His cocaine addiction compromised him at times and made him vulnerable to the arrière-pensées of members of organized criminal groups who charged him with getting valuable information regarding police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the most strict integrity rules and introduce a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the vernacular of his profession.
The unit investigating serious and organised crime in Lancashire led the investigation into Mr Ditta, who was found guilty of the three counts of cocaine possession and now entrave to justice, reflecting his commitment to pursuing criminals in court.
Let this matter serve as an warning to criminals to ensure that no one is above the law.
We will find you and you will defend yourself in the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to sell heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in the trade were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for trafficking.
On his site, Ditta held a question / answer session about himself at which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and indifference would be what motived him to work.
Renault plombé in by Nissan warning
Renault Friday posted the biggest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after partner Nissan Motor said it had decreased nearly 20 percent its full-year net profit forecast, traders reported.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a remaniement of its leadership.
Several traders reported that Renault's shares were affected this morning by the "warning."
"It's clearly Nissan's profit warning," says a senior trading officer at a London broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan's capital and the Japanese automaker 15 percent of the French, according to data from Nissan's website.
Israeli war planes target Syria, official declares
Israeli war planes hit a target in the Syrian coastal town of Latakia Thursday night, a military official confirms to Fox News.
The official did not say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reported the target was Russian SA-125 missile systems.
At least twice this year, Israel has conducted ground strikes against missile cargaison in Syria.
Fire in house built in 1850 in New York
An historic house built in 1850 was the proie of flames in the Vieux-Québec Friday midi.
The four-bedroom building, located at 15 Hébert Street, has been the subject of three alms from the fire department.
The fire broke out front, but spread across the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, a spokeswoman for the New York Fire Department, said the firefighters' quick intervention helped prevent the spread of the flames to nearby buildings, a challenge of taille for this area of the city where buildings are built in close quarters.
The burned house held four homes, but no tenants were on the property at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, though the water caused damage.
An investigation will be carried out to determine the cause, but sapeurs have dismissed the theory of a criminal act.
A year difficult for pharmaciens
The departure of nearly 10 pharmaciens at the Health and Human Services (NHS) in Laval caused much of a stir at the Health Department's City-de-la-Santé Department, and this, during the 2013 academic year.
Because of multiple breast cancer, maternité leave or all-out départs, the pharmacie department has found itself heavily déficitaire in staff.
It lacked nearly 30 percent of the needed numbers, making this financial year "very difficult," according to the department's chief, Gillian Beaudet.
Still, the NHS has decided not to engage in independent labour, which can cost up to three times more than a physician engaged full time.
We didn't have to use the dépannage, "Ms. Beaudet said.
We've rationalized or decreased some of our operations inside the facility to palier, the time things turn around.
It's sure we've worked hard to interest our young [pharmacie residents] to ensure they come and stay here.
There's a circonstances contest that made us feel we were in a bad position last year.
Situation améliorée
After this ardently difficult period, the 2013 year is expected to be considerably easier for the hospital's pharmacie department.
Already, three pharmaciennes are back to work after their leave of absence and three other pharmaciennes have been hired over the past few months.
As a result, efforts déployés by the department so that it could pick up, because the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to stay at the same hospital.
Now it's going a lot better, the sense sense of Transportation, the sense of confidence said.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmaciens and three maternité returns.
This will now come to fill our past year's losses.
Besoins still croissants
The situation also remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of nurses in hospital or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of numbers] is always precarious, because we've got a background that's young and we're employing a lot of young women, so with the grossesses, we're almost always going to have three maternité leave when it's going well, "she said.
The last year we've had a lot more and we don't have nurses available to do remplacements, so it was more difficult.

Colère caused by sentence imposed on one of Bali bomb poseurs
survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 reacted with anger at the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators to be traduit to justice, saying Umar Patek should be fussed by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years in jail as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to a life sentence for his role in making the explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released over 15 years on parole.
The 51-year-old was found guilty of mass killings for the bombings targeting two night boîtes in the popular Kuta tourist district, which caused the deaths of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and left many injured.
He was also found guilty of numerous other charges in relation to terrorism, including a wave of bombings targeting churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
Prosecutors asked for a life sentence, yet they could have asked for the man, called "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a bomb maker, to be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her two 30-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction committed by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the edge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men.
"He should be trampled before the execution peloton," Ms Corteen told AAP.
I need to live every day without having any other grandchildren, or see my daughters.
The Sari Club was fully destroyed when a massive bomb, packed in a fourgonnette parked at the scene, exploded just after 23 a.m. on Oct. 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy' s Bar when a suicide bomber there blew up a car bag packed with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He sombré into coma on the night of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he "died" three times while he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr Hugues said Patek should have faced the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah's terrorist cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed 4 1 / 2 years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before others.
Keep in it, why, there is no reason to keep it in.
Pending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the latest of Bali bomb poets to be traduit to justice.
He had managed to avoid getting captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American forces will kill the former al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had found Patek was in Pakistan to meet with ben Laden in an effort to restore ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't run," Ms. Corteen said.
Up until recently, he was eking out the chagrin he had come to cause other people.
The verdict was issued on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year," Ms. Corteen said.
Patek can also appeal his conviction.
Tony Blair has said he would consider the opportunity to become Prime Minister, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 61-year-old made his opinion of various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade as prime minister, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Quatuor's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to find the job of Prime Minister, Mr Blair would have replied, according to the London Evening Standard: "Yes, well, but it can likely happen, therefore."
Taliban Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a strike by a U.S. drone Friday in Pakistan, officials said.
The imullah Mehsud's death has been announced repeatedly already by the past.
But intelligence, army officials as well as militant mouvance said this time he had lost his life in that strike, conducted in North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike," a senior security official said.
The night before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a trip to London, had informed the British government that talks had been held with Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Imbroglio over Hôtel-Dieu's closure
Faced to the revolt led for several months by a section of staff and several unions, including the CGT, Health Minister Compana rollout on July 10 had decided to "delay the timing of implementation of the project, and in particular the deadline for the urgences which will not occur until November 4."
A request formally made "to run no risk on the care of the urgences in Paris at the start of the winter" but also aimed at not gêner Labour's campaign just months before the elections.
Despite the ministérielles instructions, the closure is just expected to be effective at this time.
Even so, at APHP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuité."
As of Nov. 4, firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40 million annual passages to the Hôtel-Dieu urgences will all have received the consigne to take the couple of serious cases a day to the urgences of other London hospitals.
That Nov. 4 date also refers to the renewal of internships.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, the specialist internes in urgences laisseront place Monday to five internes in medicine general.
According to the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the next month.
"The Hôtel-Dieu 'emergency room is due to close in the earliest possible time, and for us it is November 4," insists Loïc Capron, the chairman of the hospital's medical care committee (CME), which backs the union's plan.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming through their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the senior medical officer at the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to accommodate patients in emergency services," he tempts, making clear the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on hand to transfer the serious cases.
Senior urgentists will remain on site, he insists.
But it is to the ARS that it falls to decide the closure of the emergency department.
"Things are gradually happening," replied Nicolas Péju, a spokesman for the ARS for which on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service."
"The Chancellor lied to us or we lied to him," complained urgentiste Gérald Kierzek.
Démis from his post as head of SMUR early last July for leading the fronde against the proposed réorganisation, he describes himself as a "lanceur of alerte" amid a "cynique decision" made by "the médico-administrative vivants structure."
"They are going to vider and asphyxiate urgences that were renovated less than five years ago," he argues.
For him, "if other London emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
Yet they are frequently busy engorged.
There are by now sometimes nine hours of waiting at Lariboisière's urgences.
At the ARS, one does say that 30 "dispatched" patients on several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will by far have been strengthened.
At the ARS as well as the APHP, we are promoting the "new hospital model" already set up since October 7 and which is expected to continue to accommodate 30 million to 35 million patients a year.
By the end of the year, junior junior doctors are also expected to come forward to help with the provision of a "ambulatory care" register.
"Where will you go if you ask people to self-diagnosed," asks Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of not emergency is not dangerous" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical régression."
This is going to happen as for grade 3 maternités.
People aren't crazy, they'll go where there's the best care.
If the Chancellor does not take any action by Monday, we will change our brawls, warns Christophe Prudhomme, a médecins urgentiste and member of the CGT Health Service.
We will be even more present as part of the local government campaign and we will consider running a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, a Paris UMP member and a member of the 4e arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Paris UMP were for continued urgences at the Hôtel-Dieu it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to the responsibilities."
Anne Hidalgo, the Labour candidate, meanwhile again pointed out Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favour of a moratorium to ensure there would be no closure on November 4.
If that was the case, it would mark its net disagreement, noted Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the whole, we can't admit it without an acceptable schéma of delay to other hospitals.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past due to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The Company has revised its net earnings guidance to the hausse and is hoping for record results thanks to tourists from Australia and Britain.
The travel agency now expects to achieve underlying profit over the full year of between $325 million and $340 million before tax, up from an earlier forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth from the record $290.2 million profit reached in 2011 / 12.
Chief chief executive Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8 per cent of earnings in the first half and the second half had started in strongly, in particular in travel other than business trips to Australia and Britain.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are operating are profitable, and many of them are in good position to achieve record results over the full year before deduction of interest and taxes," he said.
This involves Australia and Britain, which are generally the countries that generate the biggest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded during the second half, which helped offset a domestic business travel market down slightly.
As well as in Britain, Flight Centre's leisure travel sector reported good results while business customers spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand is weaker and was expected to draw a profit over the full year for the third consecutive time.
Flight of Flight Centre increased 3 cents to reach $38,020 yesterday.
GM recalls some of its new pickups in U.S. to fix seat case
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to resolve a problem with the inclinable records manually, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. agency responsible for vehicle safety regulation.
On some pickups, the front seats could present a failure at the inclining mechanism.
In consequence, the cases do not meet federal vehicle safety standards regarding appuie-heads.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, it is possible the appuie-head does not properly protect passengers, further increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between Aug. 1 and Sept. 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the nation's largest car maker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM notified pickups owners of the default over the first quinzaine of October.
NHTSA could not examine the letter of information to owners because of the 16-day suspension of government operations, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM prices climbed 1.6 percent to reach $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's illness
The band Arctic Monkeys have postponed a concert in Glasgow after doctors diagnosed laryngitis to their singer.

Toronto hunt down journalists to question him over drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is believed to be drown out, several media reports said.
A video turned over appears to support those suspicions.
The intéressé, Rob Ford, has always denied having used crack, while admitting he has a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he ousted from his property several reporters to question him.
We also think sometimes the images don't have to be an explanation or comment.
Pope François Francis will name his first space kick in February
Pope François Hollande will appoint new Roman Catholic cardinal for the first time on Feb. 22, the Vatican said Thursday.
The cardinal are the highest-ranking church men in the Roman Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who edit him, meaning François will name his first group of men who in définitive will choose his successor.
There are at the moment 201 cardinaux.
Still, as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope - that now falls to a group of 120 "électeurs preschools."
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting gathering all existing round cardinal would be held ahead of the ceremony at which bishops will be raised to cardinal dignity, known as consistoire.
"Pope François has decided to communicate his decision to call the February consistoire forward so that the planning of the other meetings requires the participation of the cardinal from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voix said by February, the number of eligible papmembers will likely have declined.
He said a pope would in general appoint as many preschools as it was to ensure the number of électeurs preschools reach 120 and as many preschools as he wanted.
The consistoire next year will be important because it will be the first since Pope Benedict's election in March of this year, Valero said.
For the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint graveyard preschools from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
40 percent of romAmerican Catholiques live in South America, but a small number of the cardinal represent them.
The will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the council of the cardinal, a group of eight global round table graveyard members charged with examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope decided just fine.
"Now, François has chosen these eight need will be helping him," Valero said.
He said it was "all but possible" that François would ask for advice to the cardinaux.
But we have never had such a situation - it is completely new.
Valero said the paps were raising bishops representing vast communities to cardinal status, but that François was "full of surprises - so we don't know who he will name."

Vettel étrils special casque in Abu Dhabi
The happy winner, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the automobile brand and the German flag, while incorporating notions of speed and heat over the track.
German Sebastian Vettel, a two-time Formula One world champion, étrenned for the libres essais at Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Friday a special helmet whose drawing was made by a 22-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen among 1,500 drawings sent from around the world, part of a contest launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, from his stable.
He was invited to watch the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can now see the German champion closely, on the track and in his stand.

It is likely he will have another special helmet Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
Lou Reed died during tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died as he was doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for residents of the town of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday, aged 71
"He died Sunday morning, as he watched the trees and was performing the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands of musician fending the air," Laurie Anderson writes.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband, the week before his death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even though we are citadins, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will transmettent to many people the tremendous joy he had," she added.
Lou Reed had in May had a liver transplant.
She tries to import 2 pounds of cocaine in cigars
Because of Halloween day, a woman tried to bring to the country two pounds of cocaine hidden in cigars on Thursday morning at Montréal-Trudeau International Airport.
It was during the passenger's luggage that the drug was able to be detected.
The cocaine had been remixed in three cigars having been préalablement vidéed.
The drug was then taken to the FBI's (GRC) office that took the lead in that investigation.
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ASFC) did not disclose where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
It's part of the investigation, Jacqueline Roby, a spokeswoman for ASFC, said.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border agents at Montréal-Trudeau International have made 173 enforcement purchases, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border patrol agents made a total of 1653 enforcement purchases.
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS," is dead.
He will never have known the word retirement.
Phénomène of French publishing, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at 83, was just about to publish his 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin."
In February, the New York Times had consacré him as "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He was then about to spend 10 days in Afghanistan, home to the 198 and 199th installment of the famous series of espionnage novels.
Diminuated physically by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was traveling throughout this trip with a déambulator.
And before Afghanistan, he had also gone to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929, claimed to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul," the first of the series nearly a half century ago.
"Without doubt between 120 and 150 million people all countries confondus," he said in March.
His birch cat on his knees, in the salon of his huge apartment in a block on Foch Avenue just two blocks from the Arc de Triomphe, his eye maliciously under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Never mind pirate editions," he added, discovers a pile of books on the low table between bronzes or ivoes reported from 130 countries arched to situer his novels.
For the price of a package of cigarettes, the reader has access to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an avantaging chest, carrying a gun or an assault rifle.
At the inside, his avis khKerish altesse (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a disaffected Austrian aristocrat and CIA contraband agent to pay the repairs to the family château, runs to the troupeau of all the bad, communist soldiers of the '70s and' 80s, then Islamic militants as early as the 1990s.
At each book, the same recipe: a great dose of geopolitics and exotism, some hard sex scenes, a zest of violence and torture.
"I've never had the claim to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a contenter who writes to distraire people to whom I don't send a message.
He worked "like the great early war reporters, the type of Albert Londres, who went on and returned with real and long investigations."
SAS's father said he was "making a kind of geopolitical feuilleton."
"I am in the middle of my issues (Afghanistan, Syria,...) before I go," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the ground I meet journalists, including those from the AP, diplomats, people from the services I have known for some 20 or 30 years.
On the other hand, many of his SAS are often premonitoire: thus, a month before the attack of a Syrian regime command center killing several senior officials, he had told the story in "Le Chemin de Damas."
In "The Facts of Libya," he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in that city, the birthplace of the Libyan uprising.
In 1980, he set about the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The conspiracy from Cairo," a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako," he recalled 4X4 columns of militants who were falling upon the Mali capital.
I'm not devout, Gérard de Villiers was defending, I'm simply making hypothèse based on countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my theories are realized.
After those trips to often troubled areas, he moved for a month behind his IBM marbles writing machine dating from 1976 "whose pieces have been changed."
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corriged every page to the stylus.
At the walls of his office are hung AK-47 assault rifles, érotiques pictures and pictures of the author with African seigneurs.
Regulièrement épingled for machismo by feminist ligues and for racism by human rights organisations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed those accusations in two phrases.
Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligentes and courtly women.
I am always well received in Africa where I have very many readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age."
He will not die and will not go out.
No more than me.
More than 50 million homes were without electricity across the entire state on Friday, shortly after noon Friday because of the violent winds affecting many parts of the New England River.
The hardest hit areas are the Laurentides with 15 042 subscribers plunged into the dark, the Montérégie with 13 464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The large New York City area also has its share of outages with nearly 7000 homes without power in the city and Laval.
Menton cuts cost of its Christmas illuminations
420 motifs, 2.2 miles of sea cover covered with a light coat: you could frôl the hot weather in Menton with the cost of the illuminations.
Facture, unlike many councils, is in turn resolved by taxpayers, and not by the commerçants' association.
To ease costs, the city has used levies.
But also a separate management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Beijing accuses ouïghours of Tiananmen attack
China's domestic security chief on Friday accused a group of ethnic Tibetan separatists in Xinjiang of being behind the car bombing that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, fired on the crowd that was sitting on China's famous capital, a symbol of the deadly crackdown conducted in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passants.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the National Bureau in charge of domestic security issues, accused the Islamic Turkestan Islamic movement of being the instigator of that attack.
As many as 100,000 ouïghours, a turni-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Turkestan oriental.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for frequent eruptions of violence that are happening animée by separatist demands.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and planned," Meng told the hong-kong-based Phoenix TV station.
"The group that was held in the middle was the Islamic movement of Turkestan oriental," he said, his comments being repris by the Xinhua news agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of ouïghoure origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
This also contained récipients filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident left 42 people injured.
The Islamic movement of Turkestan oriental is considered a terrorist organization by the US and the United Nations.
Feux repeints MP seeks Brigitte Grouwels resignation
Chancellor Brigitte Grouwels's plan to "relifting" poteaux at traffic lights in Brussels does not appeal to everyone.
For mémoire, the Belgian Minister for Public works and Transport launched on Thursday in central Brussels a test project consistant in repealing 16 area traffic lights posts with the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The goal is both "increasing security" and "Belgian identity."
The idea is, at least, to repel all Belgian traffic lights, for an estimated cost of about a million euros.
But the blue chosen by the Chancellor is "too dark," according to Belgian lawmaker Emmanuel De Bock who talks of "flamandisation" of the capital and demands Brigitte Grouwels's "resignation."
"Not content with spending frivolous impassioned time on relifting signs of signalisation posts with the likes of the Belgian Région, Brigitte Grouwels continues her flaming Capitale flaming operations," Mr De Bock is fuming in a statement.
After her jaunty mangue-black taxis, she finally repealed herself in a jaunty foncé-black poteaux the poteaux of Brussels.
To the lawmaker, there is now "no difference in visual continuité between Flandre and Brussels."
Bruxellois deserve better than to have their money wasted by a CD & V minister who herself is achieving the NVA programme.
It is grand time to stop Flandre's horse of Trophus.
"For mémoire, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2 245 votes or 0.5% of the Bruxellois!," concluded Mr De Bock.
porte-porte-avions Charles-de-Gaulle in 'indisponibilité'
In Toulon, the porte-avions is in rade.
The radioactive steam leak detected on one of the two nuclear power chauffemets at the scene at the mi-octobre and as the boat was in the sea, was "no danger to the sailors," but is not without consequence to the Marine Corps.
The Royale is in the process of confirm "the ship's inavailability" until "the mi-novembre," "time to take the corrective action that is required" on the reactor.
On its part, DCNS, a defence naval specialist, insists its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the UK for the occasion, are "currently operating on the porte-avions."
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing power station.
"Everything is set to ensure that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment in late 2013," said DCNS though.
And the Marine Corps to certify that "it does not nullement remet into question the boat's business" propulsion program.
Remember the Charles-de-Gaulle porte-avions is coming off an intermédiaire maintenance period.
He had flown back from Toulon at the mi-octobre for a training session.
That, particularly, in order to describe young pilots as pilots.
A "small avarie," circonscrite to the reactor's confinement space, had then occurred on the French fleet's flagship vessel.
According to the National Guard, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
He runs in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being chassé
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barraged with a brass-drawn flag with the croix was told to leave an English supermarket, with customers complaining to the school's management who called police, the store said Friday.
"We have received several complaints from customers, so we have asked him to leave the store," said a spokeswoman for Asda's supermarket chain.
The store called police to the scene, but "the time she arrived, he was already gone without esclandre," she said.
I was doing the queue when I saw a woman who seemed shocked.
People were bouche bée.
"You don't walk so far in the street at least you would like to attract attention," a customer, Rosina Rusin, 60, testified to the Cambridge News.
That incident occurred Thursday, the Halloween holiday, when it is common to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know whether it was a canular.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for that act on his own account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've worn a black SS brassard twice a week for three years at Asda," Paul Dutton said, explaining he was suffering from "mental problems."
