# MATERIAL

This subdir has tables and scripts to produce correlations on MATERIAL experiments.

We use  2C, 2B and 2S as language IDs in material program. 

```
tables/
    Material-Joel-AQWV-MAP-2B2C2S.tsv   <-- the original file with results from all experiments
    material-correlations.tsv  <-- correlations 
    material-exp-sizes.tsv
```

`python correlations.py` reads `Material-Joel-AQWV-MAP-2B2C2S.tsv` and produces `material-correlations.tsv`
