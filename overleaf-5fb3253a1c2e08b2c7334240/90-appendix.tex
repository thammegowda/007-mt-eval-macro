\section{Metrics Reproducibility}
\label{sec:appmetrics}

\bleu\ scores reported in this work are computed with the \textsc{SacreBleu} library and has signature \texttt{\small BLEU+case.mixed+lang.<xx>-<yy>+numrefs.1 +smooth.exp+tok.<TOK>+version.1.4.13}, where \texttt{<TOK>} is \texttt{zh} for Chinese, and \texttt{13a} for all other languages. \maf1 and \mif1 use the same tokenizer as \bleu.
\chrf1 is also obtained using \textsc{SacreBleu} and has signature \texttt{\small chrF1+lang.<xx>-<yy>+numchars.6 +space.false +version.1.4.13}.
BLUERT scores are from the \textit{base} model \citet{sellam-etal-2020-bleurt}, which is fine-tuned on WMT Metrics ratings data from 2015-2018.
The BLEURT model is retrieved from \myurl{https://storage.googleapis.com/bleurt-oss/bleurt-base-128.zip}.


\section{Agreement with WMT Human judgments}
\label{sec:apphuman}

Tables \ref{tab:wmt19-kendall}, \ref{tab:wmt18-kendall}, and \ref{tab:wmt17-kendall} provide $\tau$ between MT metrics and human judgments on WMT Metrics task 2017--2019. 
$\star$\bleu\ is based on pre-computed scores in WMT metrics package, whereas \bleu\ is based on our recalculation using \textsc{SacreBleu}. 
Values marked with \insig are not significant at $\alpha=0.05$, and hence corresponding rows are excluded from the calculation of mean, median, and standard deviation.

Since \maf1 is the only metric that does not achieve statistical significance in the WMT 2019 EN-ZH setting, we carefully inspected it.
Human scores for this setting are obtained without looking at the references by bilingual speakers \cite{WMT19-metrics-proceedings}, but the ZH references are found to have a large number of bracketed EN phrases, especially proper nouns that are rare types.
When the text inside these brackets is not generated by an MT system, \maf1 naturally penalizes heavily due to the poor recall.
Since other metrics assign lower importance to poor recall of such rare types, they achieve relatively better correlation to human scores than \maf1. 
However, since the $\tau$ values for EN-ZH are relatively lower than the other language pairs, we conclude that poor correlation of \maf1 in EN-ZH is due to poor quality references.
Some settings did not achieve statistical significance due to a smaller sample set as there were fewer MT systems submitted, e.g. 2017 CS-EN.

The UNMT models follow XLM's standard architecture and are trained with 5 million monolingual sentences for each language using vocabulary size of 60,000. 
% using code base from \citet{rtg-xt20}
We train SNMT models for EN-DE and select models with the most similar (or a slightly lower) BLEU as their UNMT counterparts on newstest2019. The DE-EN model selected is trained with 1 million sentences of parallel data and a vocabulary size of 64,000, and the EN-DE model selected is trained with 250,000 sentences of parallel data and a vocabulary size of 48,000. For English$\leftrightarrow$French and English$\leftrightarrow$Romanian, we select SNMT models from submitted systems to WMT shared tasks that have similar or slightly lower BLEU scores to corresponding UNMT models, based on newstest2014 for English$\leftrightarrow$French and newstest2016 for English$\leftrightarrow$Romanian. 

Figure~\ref{fig:snmt_vs_unmt}, which is a visualization of \maf1 for SNMT and UNMT models,  shows that UNMT is generally better than SNMT on frequent types, however, SNMT outperforms UNMT on the rest indicating a cross over point in \maf1 curves. 
Since \maf1 assigns relatively higher weights to infrequent types than in \bleu{}, SNMT scores higher \maf1 than UNMT while both have the same \bleu{}, as reported in Table~\ref{tab:unmt_vs_snmt}.

The complete comparison of UNMT vs SNMT in different languages is in Table~\ref{tab:unmt_vs_snmt2}. A manual analysis of the ten sentences with the largest magnitude favoritism according to \maf1 and \bleu\ in the FR-EN and RO-EN test sets is in Table~\ref{tab:snmt_better_mf1_fren} and Table~\ref{tab:snmt_better_mf1_roen}. The complete texts of these sentences, their reference translations, and the system translations (including DE-EN mentioned in Sec~\ref{sec:unmt}), are shown in Tables \ref{tab:maf1-top-10}, \ref{tab:bleu-top-10}, \ref{tab:maf1-top-10-fren}, \ref{tab:bleu-top-10-fren}, \ref{tab:maf1-top-10-roen}, and \ref{tab:bleu-top-10-roen}.
